<h2>FCS名.fmg</h2>
<h3>FCS-G1/P01 [70000000]</h3>
<p>First-generation FCS developed by Furlong Dynamics.
This model dates from a time before Furlong specialized
in missile development, but it remains in production due
to its balanced performance and low energy burden.</p>
<h3>FCS-G2/P05 [70010000]</h3>
<p>Second-generation FCS developed by Furlong Dynamics.
This model was developed just as Furlong transitioned to
its specialization in missiles, and improves on the first
gen's specs while retaining its balanced performance.</p>
<h3>FCS-G2/P10SLT [70010100]</h3>
<p>Second-generation FCS developed by Furlong Dynamics.
This model was developed after Furlong had established
itself as a true missile specialist, and is principally
designed to reduce missile lock time.</p>
<h3>FCS-G2/P12SML [70010200]</h3>
<p>Second-generation FCS developed by Furlong Dynamics.
This model was developed after Furlong had established
itself as a true missile specialist, and is principally
designed to improve multi-lock performance.</p>
<h3>FC-006 ABBOT [70010300]</h3>
<p>Close-range combat FCS developed by Balam. In order to
achieve overwhelming superiority in close-range firearms
combat, Balam made compromises in missile performance
to instead focus on precise targeting assistance.</p>
<h3>FC-008 TALBOT [70010400]</h3>
<p>FCS for assault operations developed by Balam. Taking
lessons from the Jupiter War, Balam improved the missile
performance of their FCS products, leading to the creation
of this long-seller with excellent overall balance.</p>
<h3>VE-21A [70020000]</h3>
<p>Long-range combat FCS designed by Arquebus ADD.
A concept model designed for obliterating targets well
before contact—in many respects, a move away from Core
Theory toward earlier visions of mechanized warfare.</p>
<h3>VE-21B [70020100]</h3>
<p>Long-range combat FCS designed by Arquebus ADD.
Retains ADD's earlier focus on obliterating targets at
range, while also improving missile performance across
the board to enable a "walking fortress" style of AC.</p>
<h3>IA-C01F: OCELLUS [70030000]</h3>
<p>FCS for unpiloted ACs, developed long ago by the Rubicon
Research Institute. Capable of exceptionally high-resolution
capture in close-range engagements, making no concessions
for the human brain's limitations in processing visuals.</p>
<h3>IB-C03F: WLT 001 [70030100]</h3>
<p>FCS for piloted ACs, developed long ago by the Rubicon
Research Institute. Adapted for Coral data conductors
while still faithful to Core Theory. Excellent processing
capabilities that virtually extend the pilot's senses.</p>

<h3>System Log: One-Sided Engagement [13021530]</h3>
<p>System log extracted from a wreck.
Allows one to examine the operation of the craft prior
to its destruction.</p>
<p>The log indicates that the FCS was operating at
maximum capacity, and yet it was still unable to
track the enemy.</p>
<p>It was completely overwhelmed by V.IV Rusty's speed.
This was clearly a one-sided engagement.</p>
<h3>System Log: The Deserter [13021540]</h3>
<p>System log extracted from a wreck.
Allows one to examine the commands received by the
craft prior to its destruction.</p>
<p>No data regarding offensive or evasive maneuvers
detected.</p>
<p>It appears that the pilot of this craft immediately
pulled the emergency eject lever at the start of the
operation.</p>
<h3>Video Record: STEEL HAZE [13021550]</h3>
<p>Video record extracted from a wreck.
Allows one to discern the assembly of V.IV Rusty's AC,
STEEL HAZE.</p>
<p>The STEEL HAZE appears to be assembled from a Schneider
high-mobility frame equipped with weapons that allow
for swift, agile action.</p>
<p>Notably, Rusty appears to favor kinetic weaponry that
Vespers members would not normally use.</p>
<h3>Video Record: BAWS Arsenal No. 2 [13021560]</h3>
<p>Video record extracted from a wreck.
Contains data recorded by the craft's cameras
in the past.</p>
<p>It seems that this craft was once stationed at
BAWS Arsenal No. 2.</p>
<p>At first glance, the recovered image depicts nothing
out of the ordinary. However, on closer inspection,
one can identify noise in one corner of the picture
indicative of digital interference...</p>
<p>Potentially, an effect of Monitor Display Deception
jamming.</p>
<h3>Comms Record: Rusty's Encoded Comms [13021570]</h3>
<p>Comms record extracted from a wreck.
Contains leftover data from an attempt to intercept
V.IV Rusty's encrypted line.</p>
<hr />
<p>When......me comes...urlong will...technology...
Elcano.
You must...hidden...then.</p>
<h3>Text Data: The Well Dries [13021580]</h3>
<p>Text data extracted from a wreck.
Appears to be the auto-transcription for a voice log
recorded by an off-duty pilot.</p>
<hr />
<p>The well we found in Gallia is going to dry up sooner
than later...</p>
<p>We just can't harvest as much Coral as we used to, and
what little we do get, the corps squeeze out of us.</p>
<p>They know we need it to raise mealworms.</p>
<p>How many more children must we watch starve...?</p>
<h3>Video Record: Communication Attempt [13021590]</h3>
<p>Video record extracted from a wreck.
Contains leftover data from an attempt to communicate
with V.IV Rusty during combat.</p>
<hr />
<p>How could you...?!
I... I know who you are!</p>
<p>I've seen Uncle's files...</p>
<p>At least tell me why...!</p>
<h3>Comms Record: Friendly Comms [13021600]</h3>
<p>Comms record extracted from a wreck.
This appears to be a conversation between allies
prior to the start of a mission.</p>
<hr />
<p>We can't beat the top Vespers.
We're as good as dead...</p>
<p>At least Ziyi is off duty.
She's the Liberation Front's little sister...</p>
<p>She doesn't deserve to be out there on the battlefield.
She can still love, and be loved... Have a family...</p>
<h3>Observation Data: Coral Density Survey [13021610]</h3>
<p>Observation data extracted from a survey drone.
Contains records of surface-level Coral density at
the Central Ice Field.</p>
<hr />
<p>No major change in values compared to readings
recorded in the Belius region.</p>
<p>Likely to be cinders from the Fires of Ibis.
Inert Coral readings make up 80% of the total.</p>
<p>Analysis underway of the remaining 20%.</p>
<h3>Observation Data: Terrain Survey [13021620]</h3>
<p>Observation data extracted from a survey drone.
Contains an analysis of a surface-level scan of the
Central Ice Field.</p>
<hr />
<p>Sonar's picking up something strange—whatever it is,
you can't miss it.</p>
<p>Some kind of massive cave, perhaps?</p>
<p>...How could there be a cavity underneath this vast
sheet of ice?</p>
<h3>Observation Data: Installations Survey [13021630]</h3>
<p>Observation data extracted from a survey drone.
Contains records about old bases scattered across
the Central Ice Field.</p>
<hr />
<p>Most of these installations appear to have been built
by the Planetary Closure Administration after the
Fires of Ibis.</p>
<p>They must have been made redundant by the subsequent
completion of the Closure System. That said, with a bit
of elbow grease, we might be able to repurpose these
old ruins...</p>
<h3>Observation Data: Offshore Survey [13021640]</h3>
<p>Observation data extracted from a survey drone.
Contains records about an attempted video survey of
the ocean near the Central Ice Field.</p>
<hr />
<p>Our video data of the ocean region has a noticeable
gap. Stranger still, this hole in our records remains
regardless of how many drones we send.</p>
<p>What's going on here?
Some kind of camera interference?</p>
<h3>Video Record: Rubiconian Invective [13021650]</h3>
<p>Video record extracted from a wreck.
Appears to be a recording of a Rubicon Liberation
Front address to fellow comrades.</p>
<hr />
<p>They say that the Coral was plentiful, infinite!
Before the Fires of Ibis.</p>
<p>And then the Institute burned this planet dry.</p>
<p>The academics in their ivory tower underestimated
the power of Rubicon's blessing—and when it laid their
weakness bare, they burned it all to ash!</p>
<h3>Comms Record: Doser Ravings [13021660]</h3>
<p>Comms record extracted from a wreck.
Appears to be a leftover log of chatter between allies.</p>
<hr />
<p>Those Coral mealworms... They're just kinda...y'know.</p>
<p>Buncha crap is what they are! A teeny tiny shot of
Coral diluted all the way down until there's damn near
nothing left! No one's getting high off that!</p>
<p>That's why we're different. You gotta take Rubicon's
blessings raw... Oh man, there's nothing like it!</p>
<p>Damn right. Hits your brain with a pop and a sizzle.</p>
<h3>Text Data: Dolmayan's Writings (1) [13021670]</h3>
<p>Text data extracted from a wreck.
This appears to come from the writings of
Thumb Dolmayan, Father of the Liberation Front.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Coral is Rubicon's blessing.</p>
<p>The land is frail and withered, yet within lurks
limitless abundance—and just a single drop grants
us our flesh and blood.</p>
<p>Coral, abide with Rubicon!</p>
<h3>Text Data: Dolmayan's Writings (2) [13021680]</h3>
<p>Text data extracted from a wreck.
This appears to come from the writings of
Thumb Dolmayan, Father of the Liberation Front.</p>
<hr />
<p>How long has it been since I first "saw" her voice?</p>
<p>"Fear not," she said. "There will always be plenty."
She told me this, as I was imbibing Rubicon's blessings
one fateful day...</p>
<p>"If I were you, I'd never allow this," I replied.
And I was forever ashamed by my deceit.</p>
<h3>Text Data: Dolmayan's Writings (3) [13021690]</h3>
<p>Text data extracted from a wreck.
This appears to come from the writings of
Thumb Dolmayan, Father of the Liberation Front.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Symbiosis."
She seemed to be contemplating the meaning of the
word...</p>
<p>This moment of happiness we share comes at the cost
of her siblings—sacrifices all.</p>
<p>Is that symbiosis? Surely not...</p>
<h3>Text Data: Dolmayan's Writings (4) [13021700]</h3>
<p>Text data extracted from a wreck.
This appears to come from the writings of
Thumb Dolmayan, Father of the Liberation Front.</p>
<hr />
<p>As always, she whispers to me from inside.
She tells me that she found something in the journals
of Institute City...something about the potential for
symbiosis.</p>
<p>"Coral Release..."</p>
<p>If such a thing is truly possible, then perhaps I can
join her on the other side...</p>
<h3>Text Data: Dolmayan's Writings (5) [13021710]</h3>
<p>Text data extracted from a wreck.
This appears to come from the writings of
Thumb Dolmayan, Father of the Liberation Front.</p>
<hr />
<p>She says that she will respect my wishes.</p>
<p>If I cross this threshold, tragedy will befall the
world of mankind. Yet if I do not...</p>
<p>Here I stand, too afraid to cast the die.</p>
<h3>Text Data: Professor Nagai's Log (1) [13021720]</h3>
<p>Text data extracted from a wreck.
The lost auto-transcription for a voice log recorded by
Prof. Nagai, the Rubicon Research Institute director.</p>
<hr />
<p>Coral is an organic substance capable of
self-propagation. The speed at which it proliferates
is determined by the density of the colony.
As such, a vacuum would provide an ideal environment
to maximize Coral density and thus growth.</p>
<p>However, one must not overlook the signs of mutations
within the Coral brought about by this density effect;
it is mutations such as these that will bring about
a collapse that humanity has no hope of controlling.</p>
<h3>Text Data: Professor Nagai's Log (2) [13021730]</h3>
<p>Text data extracted from a wreck.
The lost auto-transcription for a voice log recorded by
Prof. Nagai, the Rubicon Research Institute director.</p>
<hr />
<p>Assistant No. 1 has lost his mind.
His research has utterly consumed him.</p>
<p>Granted, there may be some logic to C-Pulse sensory
augmentation of human subjects—but no ethical scholar
would ever dare cross that point of no return.</p>
<p>Mankind is driven mad by possibilities.
What does Coral represent, if not sheer potential?</p>
<h3>Text Data: Professor Nagai's Log (3) [13021740]</h3>
<p>Text data extracted from a wreck.
The lost auto-transcription for a voice log recorded by
Prof. Nagai, the Rubicon Research Institute director.</p>
<hr />
<p>I have decided that Assistant No. 1's son is to remain
at the lab. He's a reticent one—tough, too, beyond his
years. And now, our research has robbed him of his
mother and driven his father mad. He has every right
to hate me...</p>
<p>Perhaps Assistant No. 2 will be able to help.
She does seem to have a knack for assembling toys...
I hope that at least she can give him something to
smile about.</p>
<h3>Text Data: Professor Nagai's Log (4) [13021750]</h3>

Prof. Nagai, the Rubicon Research Institute director.</p>
<hr />
<p>No—
The Coral tide is rising at an abnormal rate!</p>
<p>This resonance—it suggests some kind of mutation...
Run the calculations. How much time do we have?</p>
<p>47 hours, 2 minutes, 16 seconds.</p>
<p>We still have time.
Deploy Ibis!</p>
<h3>Video Record: The Fires of Ibis [13021760]</h3>
<p>Video record extracted from a wreck.
Includes audio of what may be the last words spoken
by Prof. Nagai, the Rubicon Research Institute director.</p>
<hr />
<p>12 minutes remain. I have done all that I must.</p>
<p>I alone shall bear the burden of watching
the Fires of Ibis burn.</p>
<p>Whatever future awaits the boy, I hope he grows
into a man strong enough to seize it.</p>
<p>I have friends in the Jupiter colonies...
Surely they will look after him.</p>
<h3>Image Data: STV Sketch (3) [13021770]</h3>
<p>A sketch by STV, a masked battlefield artist said by
some to be one of the last artists to dedicate his
career to the art of hand-drawn portraits. His works
command a high value among collectors in the know.</p>
<hr />
<p>//STV's notes
• Awful bunch. Never again.</p>
<h3>Image Data: STV Sketch (4) [13021780]</h3>
<p>A sketch by STV, a masked battlefield artist said by
some to be one of the last artists to dedicate his
career to the art of hand-drawn portraits. His works
command a high value among collectors in the know.</p>
<hr />
<p>//STV's notes
• Request for interview was met with snide derision
   by the most important-looking member of the group.</p>
<p>• They're not all bad, though. One of them offered
   me a cup of coffee, or something like it.</p>
<h3>Image Data: STV Sketch (1) [13021790]</h3>
<p>A sketch by STV, a masked battlefield artist said by
some to be one of the last artists to dedicate his

<p>//STV's notes
• Old man (seated) looks like he's seen some things.</p>
<h3>Image Data: STV Sketch (2) [13021800]</h3>
<p>A sketch by STV, a masked battlefield artist said by
some to be one of the last artists to dedicate his
career to the art of hand-drawn portraits. His works
command a high value among collectors in the know.</p>
<hr />
<p>//STV's notes
• The woman's the one in charge, and she's the smartest
   of the bunch. Have I seen her somewhere else before,
   though?</p>
<h3>Image Data: STV Sketch (6) [13021810]</h3>
<p>A sketch by STV, a masked battlefield artist said by
some to be one of the last artists to dedicate his
career to the art of hand-drawn portraits. His works
command a high value among collectors in the know.</p>
<hr />
<p>//STV's notes
• These independent mercenaries are members of a
   group of four (one serves as an operator). Weren't
   willing to answer many questions.</p>
<p>• Never got to meet the group's fourth merc, either.</p>
<h3>Image Data: STV Sketch (5) [13021820]</h3>
<p>A sketch by STV, a masked battlefield artist said by
some to be one of the last artists to dedicate his
career to the art of hand-drawn portraits. His works
command a high value among collectors in the know.</p>
<hr />
<p>//STV's notes
• Caught a couple of hired killers on the prowl—
   managed to sneak in a sketch without being noticed.</p>
<p>• "The fool won't pay back what he owes," one said.</p>
<h3>Image Data: STK Sketch [13021830]</h3>
<p>A sketch by the famed artist STK, who perished half
a century ago during the Fires of Ibis.
His style was assimilated by AI artists, and with
time mimicry supplanted the real technique.</p>
<hr />
<p>//Notes (STK)
• Prof., two assistants, boy
• Assistant 1's heading for a breakdown
• Boy's sharper than he looks</p>
<h3>Observation Data: The City of Xylem [13021840]</h3>
<p>Observation data extracted from a survey drone.
Perhaps this was recorded by Handler Walter's "friend."</p>
<hr />
<p>Xylem remains fully operational.</p>
<p>The Planetary Closure Administration did their best
to hide the place, but I'll find a way there soon
enough...</p>
<p>The only ones who know are the PCA, and—</p>
<h3>Video Record: G4's Last Words [13021850]</h3>
<p>Video record extracted from a wreck.
An incomplete message sent from one member of the
Redguns to another, apparently just before death.</p>
<hr />
<p>Iguazu, I'm telling you, man, you gotta give Michigan
a chance. He's different from the suits at HQ.</p>
<p>Look, I know he's an asshole, but he's looking out for
us, you know? Almost like we got a family here, heh.</p>
<p>Man, if there's anyone who deserves punching out,
it's the freaks who sent us on this suicide mission.
You picked a good day to go AWOL... Wish I—</p>
<h3>Text Data: The Re-education Center [13021860]</h3>
<p>Text data extracted from a wreck.
Makes reference to the Arquebus Re-education Center.</p>
<hr />
<p>• To facilitate smooth progress of the Coral response
   survey, a temporary branch of AREC is to be
   installed on Rubicon.
• Primary subjects are to be Rubiconist POWs.
   Re-education of hostile corporate assets
   permissible as the situation dictates.
• Subjects who are resistant to re-education and
   who possess a certain degree of combat skill are
   to be processed according to the relevant
   procedures and transferred to the Factory.</p>
<h3>Video Record: Testing New Components [13021880]</h3>
<p>Video record extracted from a wreck.
One can see performance tests of an unpiloted AC.
An officer's voice can be heard in the background.</p>
<hr />
<p>I see no significant difference in performance compared
to what an AI can achieve... How very disappointing.
This experiment was another failure, then.</p>
<p>Regardless, I will have answers. The arrival of ACs
brought the age of unpiloted craft to an end...
but what essential difference makes them superior?</p>
<p>Send a message to the Factory.
Have them leave the torso intact next time.</p>
<h3>Video Record: BAWS Guard's Last Words [13021890]</h3>
<p>Video record extracted from a wreck.
It seems that a guard stationed at BAWS Arsenal No. 2
was shot dead by an unknown aggressor.</p>
<hr />
<p>You're just on edge, man.
BAWS supplies MTs to the off-world corps, too.
No one would ever touch this arsenal.</p>
<p>Gotta move as many units as we can to bankroll Elcano.
That's the only way we Rubiconians stand a...</p>
<p>What was that? The connection's—</p>
<h3>Video Record: The Collector's Last Words [13021900]</h3>
<p>Video record extracted from a wreck.
An AC that infiltrated Grid 086 appears to have
been received by an RaD welcoming party.</p>
<hr />
<p>Wait! Let's not do anything hasty!</p>
<p>I'm no one, okay? I'm just a lowly debt collector.
I didn't know this was your turf, I swear!</p>
<p>The guy I'm after, he's a tricky one.
He could be hiding anywhere in the Grid by now...</p>
<p>Wait—no, please!
You don't have to kill me!</p>
<h3>Comms Record: Message for Uncle [13021910]</h3>
<p>Comms record extracted from a wreck.
Appears to have been left by an RLF messenger who
infiltrated earlier but was killed by the corporations.</p>
<hr />
<p>I have to get this back to Uncle!</p>
<p>Furlong agreed to provide technological assistance.
Now the new model can finally be completed...</p>
<p>He has to know—before those two destroy each other!</p>
<h3>Comms Record: Doser Chatter [13021920]</h3>
<p>Comms record extracted from a wreck.
Appears to be a leftover log of chatter between allies.</p>
<hr />
<p>Wanna hear something wild? Turns out those big shots
at the PCA who run the satellites take their orders from
an AI. They're working for a computer, man!</p>
<p>What? Ha, guess you're right.
Then again...we're not too different there, huh.</p>
<p>Yeah, but at least Chatty follows the boss's orders.
S'pose he's just programmed that way, though...</p>
<h3>Comms Record: Coyote Chatter [13021930]</h3>
<p>Comms record extracted from a wreck.
Appears to be a leftover log of chatter between allies.</p>
<hr />
<p>I dunno about our new boss... Think we can trust him?</p>
<p>You think Carla's better? She's got the nerve to call
herself a freakin' Cinder. Nice try, lady, but you're a
little young for that stolen valor.</p>
<p>Man. Are those people at RaD full of shit or what?</p>
<h3>Comms Record: Independent Merc Comms [13021940]</h3>
<p>Comms record extracted from a wreck.
Evidence of independent mercenaries sharing
intelligence with one another.</p>
<hr />
<p>Looks like the PCA inspectors are on the move.
Make sure the "four" know.</p>
<p>As for the other corps, well...
Melinite and Takigawa don't seem too ambitious.
All they care about is selling their products.</p>
<p>Furlong, though... They're pretending to be neutral,
but you know those crafty foxes would never make a
move out in the open.</p>
<h3>Comms Record: Enforcement Squad Comms [13021950]</h3>
<p>Comms record extracted from a wreck.
Appears to be information shared between members
of an enforcement squad.</p>
<hr />
<p>We do what the notice from the System tells us.
For now, focus on mopping up the corporate forces.</p>
<p>Make sure to keep an eye on the independent
mercenaries, too.</p>
<p>We have Branch to thank for causing this mess...</p>
<p>No doubt they've landed on Rubicon.</p>
<h3>Observation Data: Wave Mutation Detected [13021960]</h3>
<p>Observation data extracted from an AC of unknown
affiliation.
Appears to have once been heavily encoded, then
cracked by a third party.</p>
<hr />
<p>A wave mutation has been detected.
It's happening.</p>
<p>The aging mercenary is the ideal candidate to serve
as the trigger...
We must now bring the third factor into play.</p>
<h3>Observation Data: Blind Spots [13021970]</h3>
<p>Observation data extracted from an AC of unknown
affiliation.
Appears to have once been heavily encoded, then
cracked by a third party.</p>
<hr />
<p>The aftereffects of the Fires of Ibis are causing
anomalies that frustrate attempts to observe a
number of sites.</p>
<p>The Central Ice Field is dotted with many such
"blind spots"—areas that cannot be observed off-planet.</p>
<p>The PCA would be keen to exploit these.
We'll surely find the first Watchpoint there.</p>
<h3>Observation Data: The Enforcement System [13021980]</h3>
<p>Observation data extracted from an AC of unknown

<p>The Enforcement System had been buried deep within
Rubicon all this time. Little wonder that the
suppression fleet was so quick to arrive..</p>
<p>For now, we shall monitor the Observers' actions...
and provide indirect aid to Arquebus.</p>
<h3>Text Data: Professor Nagai's Log (5) [13021990]</h3>
<p>Text data extracted from a wreck.
The lost auto-transcription for a voice log recorded by
Prof. Nagai, the Rubicon Research Institute director.</p>
<hr />
<p>There is no averting the ruin that awaits both
the Institute and Rubicon itself.
I must now concern myself with what follows.</p>
<p>The data shows signs of wave mutation...
Observation must continue.</p>
<p>Assistant No. 2 is our only remaining hope.
Though it pains me, I have no choice but to pass the legacy
of our sins onto her—my own student.</p>

<h2>ジェネレーター名.fmg</h2>
<h3>AG-J-098 JOSO [65000000]</h3>
<p>Internal combustion generator developed by BAWS for
an old-generation AC. Performance is not dissimilar to
generic labor MT models, making it an unreliable choice
for combat use in a modern AC build.</p>
<h3>DF-GN-02 LING-TAI [65010000]</h3>
<p>Internal combustion generator developed by Dafeng Core
Industries. Commissioned by Balam, the specifications for
this model demanded lightweight construction matched
with excellent EN recharge capabilities.</p>
<h3>DF-GN-06 MING-TANG [65010100]</h3>
<p>Internal combustion generator developed by Dafeng Core
Industries. A joint development with Balam, this model
focuses on ensuring good EN capacity and recharging.</p>
<h3>VP-20S [65010200]</h3>
<p>Circulating-current generator developed by Arquebus.
Tailored to lightweight ACs, such as those built by
Schneider, efforts were made to keep its weight modest
while providing capable output for its size.</p>
<h3>VP-20C [65010300]</h3>
<p>Circulating-current generator developed by Arquebus.
The design goal for this model was to create a generator
with no drawbacks, resulting in a product that provides
stable performance in any AC assembly.</p>
<h3>AG-E-013 YABA [65010400]</h3>
<p>Internal combustion generator developed by BAWS for modern
ACs. A balanced model capable of withstanding the demands
of modern combat, its development was aimed at narrowing
Rubicon's post-closure technological gap.</p>
<h3>VE-20A [65020000]</h3>
<p>Circulating-current generator designed by Arquebus ADD.
Engineered to support high-spec energy weapon prototypes,
it maximizes EN output at the expense of sacrificing
performance in other regards.</p>
<h3>VE-20B [65020100]</h3>
<p>Circulating-current generator designed by Arquebus ADD.
Engineered to maximize energy weapon specialization, this
model even sacrifices EN output to a degree, positioning
its performance somewhere close to a concept model.</p>
<h3>IA-C01G: AORTA [65030000]</h3>
<p>Coral-based internal combustion generator developed long
ago by the Rubicon Research Institute. This model takes
advantage of the Coral's biological traits, enabling rapid
recovery by pushing combustion to its limit.</p>
<h3>IB-C03G: NGI 000 [65030100]</h3>
<p>Prototype Coral-based internal combustion generator
developed long ago by the Rubicon Research Institute.
Optimized for power-hungry Coral weapons, with rapid
EN recovery enabled by maximized combustion.</p>
<h3>DF-GN-08 SAN-TAI [65040000]</h3>
<p>Internal combustion generator developed by Dafeng Core
Industries. This model was designed for use with the
corporation's independently-manufactured heavyweight
ACs, and features outstanding EN capacity.</p>
<h3>VP-20D [65040100]</h3>
<p>Circulating-current generator developed by Arquebus.
Designed with a focus on EN capacity and output to support
Arquebus energy weapons, it supplies more raw power than
any other corporate product on the market.</p>
<h3>AG-T-005 HOKUSHI [65040200]</h3>
<p>BAWS internal combustion generator developed in tandem
with Elcano. Improved output allows for use of high-burden
parts, but supply recovery performance leaves much to be
desired, calling for a degree of EN management finesse.</p>
<h3>VE-20C [65040300]</h3>
<p>Circulating-current generator designed by Arquebus ADD.
Features improved EN capacity and output while retaining a
focus on energy weapon specialization. However, it suffers
from a heavy weight burden and recharging difficulties.</p>

<p>The reticle automatically targets on-screen enemies.</p>
<p>When there are multiple enemies, the enemy closest
to the center of the screen will be prioritized.
Move the camera to change the priority target.</p>
<p>When enabled, Target Assist will automatically orient
the camera and your AC toward the current target.
However, this comes at the cost of reduced aiming
precision. Consider the situation and your level of

<h3>Adaptive Assemblies [1506000]</h3>
<p>During real missions, you can expect enemy
reinforcements and other changes to the situation.</p>
<p>The test of an advanced mercenary is in their ability to
adjust to a wide range of combat scenarios and adapt
their AC assembly to meet the needs of the mission.</p>
<h3>Advantages of Disabling Target Assist [1509090]</h3>
<p>When Target Assist is disabled, target tracking will
benefit from improved performance, and you will have
full control over which direction your AC moves in.</p>
<p>Consider situational use of Target Assist and look for
opportunities to take full control of your targeting
within your level of proficiency as a mercenary.</p>
<h3>Evasive Aerial Maneuvers [1600000]</h3>
<p>Explosive attacks have a blast radius, and even if
you dodge the initial hit, it's easy to get caught by
the blast if you remain on the ground.</p>
<p>Evasive aerial maneuvers are a good way to handle
attacks that are difficult to dodge by merely
Quick Boosting.</p>

<h3>The Right Assembly for the Job [1601000]</h3>
<p>When a strong enemy seems like an impossible challenge,
it's more likely that the assembly of your AC is working
against you.</p>
<p>Check out the mercenary support simulators to see
how your AC assembly changes your options.</p>
<h3>Tactical Reloading [1602000]</h3>
<p>When an enemy is close to being staggered, make sure
your weapons aren't about to reload or overheat.
You need to be ready to exercise maximum firepower
against the target while it's vulnerable.</p>

<h3>Arm Units [2201000]</h3>
<p>Hand weapons can be installed to the left and right
arm units of an AC.</p>
<p>These weapons range from machine guns and other small
arms to heavier weapons, such as a bazookas, that offer
high firepower at the cost of forcing the AC to assume
a firing stance.</p>
<p>Melee weapons can only be installed to the left hand.
However, they all feature excellent attack power and
impact potency.</p>
<h3>Back Units [2202000]</h3>
<p>Shoulder weapons can be installed to the left and
right back units of an AC.</p>
<p>These weapons include missile launchers, which can
be used during movement, as well as heavy weapons
like cannons that are too large to be held in the hand.</p>
<p>Shields can only be installed to the left shoulder and
offer varying defensive performances and properties.</p>
<h3>Heads [2203000]</h3>
<p>One of the components that constitute an AC frame.</p>
<p>Heads influence system abnormality resistance and
scan performance.</p>
<p>They also affect AP and defensive performance.</p>
<h3>Cores [2204000]</h3>
<p>One of the components that constitute an AC frame.</p>
<p>Cores apply adjustments to the performance of
"inner" parts, namely the boosters and generator.</p>
<p>They also affect AP and defensive performance.</p>
<h3>Arms [2205000]</h3>
<p>One of the components that constitute an AC frame.</p>
<p>Arms influence the AC's hand weapon carrying capacity,
the precision of predictive fire for ranged weapons,
the attack power of melee weapons, and so on.</p>
<p>They also affect AP and defensive performance.</p>
<h3>Legs [2206000]</h3>
<p>One of the components that constitute an AC frame.</p>
<p>Legs influence overall loading capacity for the AC and
mobility of on-the-ground movement. They also affect
AP and defensive performance.</p>
<p>There are multiple types of leg units with different
behavior for jumps, Quick Boosts, and so on.</p>
<h3>Boosters [2207000]</h3>
<p>Boosters greatly influence AC mobility.</p>
<p>Your choice of booster determines the speed of the AC's
movements, its speed when ascending, and the thrust of
Quick Boosts or Assault Boosts.</p>
<p>However, be aware that higher-performing boosters tend
to consume greater and greater amounts of EN (energy).</p>
<h3>FCS [2208000]</h3>
<p>The FCS (Fire Control System) greatly influences
an AC's offensive performance.</p>
<p>Your choice of FCS determines target tracking at
close, medium, or long range, and also affects the time
it takes to achieve missile lock-on or multi-lock.</p>
<p>Make sure you choose an FCS that is appropriate for
the weapons you have chosen.</p>
<h3>Generators [2209000]</h3>
<p>Generators greatly influence basic AC performance.</p>
<p>Your choice of generator influences the range of parts
you can install to your AC and determines EN capacity
and recovery speed. When selecting parts, make sure
that you choose those that are most compatible with
your AC assembly.</p>
<h3>Assault Armor [2210000]</h3>
<p>Core Expansion: Assault Armor. Creates a pulse explosion
centered on the AC, canceling out incoming enemy fire
and creating a damaging area-of-effect shockwave.</p>
<p>With Assault Armor equipped,</p>
<?kgicon@22?>
<ul>
<li>: Activate Assault Armor</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pulse Armor [2211000]</h3>
<p>Core Expansion: Pulse Armor. Creates a pulse barrier
that trails the AC, dramatically increasing defensive
performance until it exceeds its durability or time
limit.</p>
<p>With Pulse Armor equipped,</p>
<?kgicon@22?>
<ul>
<li>: Activate Pulse Armor</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pulse Protection [2212000]</h3>
<p>Core Expansion: Pulse Protection. Creates a pulse barrier
in a fixed position, providing cover from enemy fire until
the barrier reaches its durability limit. The barrier is
not permanent and will disappear after time has passed.</p>
<p>With Pulse Protection equipped,</p>
<?kgicon@22?>
<ul>
<li>: Activate Pulse Protection</li>
</ul>
<h3>Terminal Armor [2213000]</h3>
<p>Core Expansion: Terminal Armor. An emergency variant
of Pulse Armor that trails the AC, activating when the AC
has reached critical AP damage.</p>
<p>When equipped, Terminal Armor activates automatically
when your AC is about to be destroyed.</p>
<h3>Weight Control [2214000]</h3>
<p>System unlock: Weight Control.</p>
<p>Enables you to sortie using an AC that is over the weight
limit, which is normally prohibited. Furthermore, this
feature also allows you to manually purge (discard)
weapons.</p>
<p>Purging weapons reduces the weight of your AC, allowing
you to tactically switch your craft from an overweight
state to normal mobility.</p>
<?kgicon@26?>
<ul>
<li>weapon input: Manually Purge Weapon</li>
</ul>
<h3>Boost Kick [2215000]</h3>
<p>System unlock: Boost Kick.</p>
<p>Allows you to kick using the AC's legs as a follow-up
action after performing an Assault Boost.</p>
<p>This attack is influenced by the speed and weight of
the AC, making it a viable option for overloading an
enemy's ACS.</p>
<?kgicon@9?>
<p>during Assault Boost: Boost Kick</p>
<h3>Weapon Bay [2216000]</h3>
<p>System unlock: Weapon Bay.</p>
<p>Enables you to equip the left and right shoulders of your
AC with two additional hand weapons.</p>
<p>With hand weapons equipped to shoulder units:</p>
<?kgicon@20?>
<p>: Switch Right Hand Weapon</p>
<?kgicon@19?>
<p>: Switch Left Hand Weapon</p>
<h3>Manual Aiming [2217000]</h3>
<p>System unlock: Manual Aiming.</p>
<p>Enables manual aiming mode. Generally, it is unrealistic
to expect to land attacks in this mode, but it does enable
you to "lead" your shots if you can correctly predict
enemy movements; that is to say, to shoot where you
expect the enemy to be, not where the enemy is.</p>
<p>Hold <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#63;&#107;&#103;&#105;&#99;&#111;&#110;&#64;&#49;&#53;&#63;">&#63;&#107;&#103;&#105;&#99;&#111;&#110;&#64;&#49;&#53;&#63;</a>: Enable Manual Aiming</p>
<?kgicon@15?>
<p>with Manual Aiming ON: Disable Manual Aiming</p>
<h3>Quick Turn [2218000]</h3>
<p>System unlock: Quick Turn.</p>
<p>Enables the ability to perform snap turns to side or
rear directions.</p>
<?kgicon@6?>
<ul>
<li>: Quick Turn in input direction</li>
</ul>
<h3>System Abnormality: ACS Failure [2219000]</h3>
<p>AC system abnormality: ACS Failure</p>
<p>Excessively high temperatures cause ACS errors, with
the result that incoming impact damage is increased.
This in turn makes the AC more vulnerable to stagger.</p>
<p>AC systems will recover a short time after the effect
has been triggered.</p>
<h3>System Abnormality: Shock [2220000]</h3>
<p>AC system abnormality: Shock</p>
<p>A sudden overload forces a discharge of the AC's
electrical systems, resulting in unavoidable damage.</p>
<h3>Basic Controls [2221000]</h3>
<p>Basic AC controls are as follows.</p>
<?kgicon@91?>
<p>: Camera</p>
<?kgicon@90?>
<p>: Movement</p>
<?kgicon@90?>
<ul>
<li>: Boost Movement ON</li>
</ul>
<?kgicon@8?>
<p>: Jump (Hold: Ascend)</p>
<?kgicon@18?>
<p>: Use Right Hand Weapon</p>
<?kgicon@17?>
<p>: Use Left Hand Weapon</p>
<?kgicon@20?>
<p>: Use Right Shoulder Weapon</p>
<?kgicon@19?>
<p>: Use Left Shoulder Weapon</p>
<h3>Canceling Actions [2222000]</h3>
<p>While charging a ranged weapon,</p>
<?kgicon@22?>
<p>: Cancel Charge</p>
<p>During multi-lock,</p>
<?kgicon@22?>
<p>: Cancel Multi-Lock</p>
<p>During Assault Boost,</p>
<?kgicon@3?>
<p>: Cancel Assault Boost</p>
<h3>System Abnormality: Camera Disruption [2223000]</h3>
<p>AC system abnormality: Camera Disruption</p>
<p>Cameras are impeded by a jamming effect,
reducing lock-on range.</p>
<p>System functionality can be restored by escaping
the area of effect.</p>

well balanced and offers stable performance even
when used as part of a medium-weight assembly.</p>
<h3>BUERZEL/21D [60040000]</h3>
<p>Booster specialized for long-distance cruising, developed
by Schneider. Maximizes Assault Boost thrust and energy
efficiency to provide excellent performance when rapidly
closing in on a target from long range.</p>
<h3>BST-G2/P06SPD [60050000]</h3>
<p>Second-generation booster developed by Furlong Dynamics.
This model prizes movement speed over Quick Boost
thrust, making it a good fit for assemblies that are
designed for endurance.</p>
<h3>BC-0200 GRIDWALKER [60060000]</h3>
<p>Booster developed by RaD for lightweight machines.
A design subcontracted by Elcano, this model was built for
transport operations in the Grid and on other complex
terrain, with only a modest EN requirement when in midair.</p>
<h3>IB-C03B: NGI 001 [60070000]</h3>
<p>Prototype booster for piloted ACs, developed long ago by
the Rubicon Research Institute. This model's design
makes allowances for exoatmospheric operation, with a
particular focus on enhanced Quick Boost-related specs.</p>
<h3>IA-C01B: GILLS [60070100]</h3>
<p>Booster for unpiloted ACs, developed long ago by the
Rubicon Research Institute. No consideration has been
given to the g-force tolerance of human pilots, enabling
uncompromising performance and rapid-fire Quick Boosts.</p>
<h3>AB-J-137 KIKAKU [60070200]</h3>
<p>Booster developed by BAWS for an old-generation AC.
An early AC model, it marked an attempt to faithfully
represent Core Theory, and so its booster's specs were
tweaked for melee performance—such was the trend.</p>
<h3>BC-0400 MULE [60070300]</h3>
<p>Booster developed by RaD for heavyweight machines.
Designed for heavy-industry ACs primarily working on
the ground, it suffers from a slow vertical boost but
boasts excellent energy efficiency.</p>
<h3>BST-G1/P10 [60070400]</h3>
<p>First-generation booster developed by Furlong Dynamics.
Though inferior to current models, this booster remains
a viable choice, especially for lightweight assemblies,
due to its modest energy burden and ease of use.</p>

<h2>ランカープロフィール.fmg</h2>
<p>[100] A member of RaD, a Doser faction.</p>
<p>Like many other Dosers, Rummy is utterly addicted to
Coral-based drugs, and in his perpetually addled state, he
has convinced himself that he is an invincible demi-god.</p>
<p>Even should reality intervene with a costly defeat, he
will forget about the setback entirely by the next day—
only death can dispel his notions of invincibility now.</p>
<p>[101] A guerilla leader of the Rubicon Liberation Front.</p>
<p>A blue-collar worker who was involved in the construction
of the Grid, he is now dedicated to establishing symbiosis
with the Coral and building a future for Rubicon free from
planetary closure, inspired by Father Dolmayan's ideals.</p>
<p>Able-bodied and eager, he is zealously dedicated to the
cause—but he is more at home in the construction yard
than the cockpit.</p>
<p>[102] Gun Six of the Redguns, the Balam Group's AC squad.</p>
<p>As a young boy, Red's life was forever changed when he
saw the news broadcasts of Commander Michigan's brutal
triumphs in the Jupiter War.</p>
<p>Red trained through blood, sweat and tears in order to
emulate his idol, supporting his impoverished siblings
all the while. When the Balam admission examination
finally came, he won his place in the Redguns at the
very moment he stood to attention to greet the squad.</p>
<p>[103] An independent mercenary who snuck onto Rubicon hoping
to get rich quick, taking advantage of the chaos brought
about by the extraplanetary corporations' forays.</p>
<p>Under Nosaac's "economic theory," the funds of others are
but extensions of his own resources. Thus he continues to
take on debt with no intention of repayment, as in his
eyes, the money was his anyway. This does have the benefit
of allowing him to buy the latest in corporate technology
as soon as it hits the market; he considers the power of
his AC an asset to his credit score.</p>
<p>[104] Sixth squad leader of the Vespers, the Arquebus Group's
augmented human squad.</p>
<p>Maeterlinck is a product of Generation Eight, which was
held to have advanced the process to the point of
rendering all previous generations obsolete, bringing
about a new age of augmentation.</p>
<p>Unfailingly loyal to Arquebus, she has a reliable track
record in the field, and her conduct during missions has
established her as a risk-averse problem-solver.</p>
<p>[105] A warrior of the Rubicon Liberation Front.</p>
<p>As an infant, Ziyi was taken to Rubicon by her parents—
who, tempted by the promise of riches from Coral mining,
sought to make an illegal entry to the planet.</p>
<p>Only Ziyi survived the crash landing. She came under the
guardianship of Uncle Flatwell of the Rubicon Liberation
Front, and the core of an AC was the young orphan's cradle
as she grew up to become a Coral Warrior.</p>
<p>[106] Seventh squad leader of the Vespers, the Arquebus Group's
augmented human squad.
Swinburne is a product of Generation Seven, the first
to receive experimental augmentation using Coral
substitution technology.</p>
<p>This granted him enhanced aptitude as a pilot without the
usual complications—but with no obvious indication of
either efficacy or potential side effects, Swinburne's
fears and doubts turned into an overpowering paranoia,
the final jewel to crown his odious personality.</p>
<p>[107] Gun Three of the Redguns, the Balam Group's AC squad.</p>
<p>A born con artist, no scheme was too underhanded for
Wu Huahai during his days as criminal mastermind, and
exploitation of others was a byword for opportunity.
However, his illicit Feng Shui Pharmacy operation was
a fatal overstep, imperiling the health of Balam's
economic sphere and leading to widespread disease.</p>
<p>It was Nile, now the deputy commander of the Redguns,
who ultimately shut Wu Huahai down.</p>
<p>[108] A warrior of the Rubicon Liberation Front.</p>
<p>Paramour and personal attendant to Dolmayan, Freddie
maintains an aloof distance from his fellow comrades.</p>
<p>An admirer of the inner world of Dolmayan's mind, he
entered the battlefield so that the father of the
Liberation Front would never need be alone.</p>
<p>[109] Fifth squad leader of the Vespers, the Arquebus Group's
augmented human squad.
Like Swinburne, Hawkins is a member of Generation Seven,
and has lost a great many colleagues and subordinates to
the progress of science in revolutionizing the surgery.</p>
<p>However, he has reached a certain peace with their
sacrifices, knowing that his generation of surgery is far
safer than those of the past—free of the loss of humanity
inflicted on the Coral technology generations, or the
grisly accidents of the interim generations.</p>
<p>[110] Gun Five of the Redguns, the Balam Group's AC squad.</p>
<p>A backstreet gambler, Iguazu bet big and lost, and he
was forced to undergo experimental 4th-generation
augmentation surgery to pay back his debtors.</p>
<p>In his new life, he quickly began to quarrel with Volta,
his oftentimes partner in crime. Iguazu's recalcitrant
nature was such that one day he even picked a fight with
the Hero of Jupiter, who retaliated with such fury that
Iguazu never quite looked the same afterward.</p>
<p>[111] A wandering independent mercenary who shelters with
the Rubicon Liberation Front.
Well versed in long-lost classical theater, he has a
particular interest in "ninjas" and "kabuki," relics of
the past that he learned of from the Japanese immigrant
culture which now heavily influences his eccentric style.</p>
<p>Once, when Rokumonsen was on the brink of starvation, he
was rescued by Ziyi, who offered him food and shelter—and
ever since that day, he has been the sworn enemy of those
who would do her and her comrades harm.</p>
<p>[112] Gun Four of the Redguns, the Balam Group's AC squad.</p>
<p>After beating the rebellious Volta and Iguazu into
submission, Michigan made it his personal crusade to make
something of the two, and thus began their daily hell.</p>
<p>For the past seven years, neither Volta nor Iguazu have
achieved their goal: "to punch the living daylights out
of Michigan, then get the hell out of the Redguns" (as
they would put it). Volta has since admitted defeat,
and is now learning about business from Wu Huahai.</p>
<p>[113] Eighth squad leader of the Vespers, the Arquebus Group's
augmented human squad.
A product of Generation Ten—the latest, and currently
practiced, form of augmentation surgery—Pater represents
the culmination of efforts to preserve the patient's
humanity through Coral replacement technology.</p>
<p>At times, his noticeably unreserved remarks hint at an
underlying lack of empathy—one might assume this to be
a side effect of the surgery, but this trait has in fact
been with him since long before his augmentation.</p>
<p>[114] A veteran independent mercenary who was active in the
star system surrounding Rubicon before the Fires of Ibis.
Sulla is a patient of Generation One augmentation—or
better said, a survivor, as the technology in its infancy
had less than a 10% success rate. Though he escaped the
fate of the others, Sulla is followed by the specter of
Death wherever he goes.</p>
<p>After receiving his surgery, Sulla lost interest in most
mercenary work, and now lives only for the hunt.
It is unclear who currently employs him.</p>
<p>[115] The right hand of RaD's ringleader and chief engineer,
"Cinder" Carla.</p>
<p>One day, Carla built a simple suggestion-based AI to
provide basic support and occasional entertainment.</p>
<p>However, no matter what conversational prompt she gave
"him," he would never say more than necessary.</p>
<p>Instead, it seemed that he was content to be a good
listener to his creator's free-spirited, eccentric ideas.</p>
<p>[116] The de facto military leader of the Rubicon Liberation
Front.</p>
<p>His authority is second only to that of Father Dolmayan,
and his standing within the organization has earned him
an informal title as a fellow elder—he is the "Uncle" of
the Liberation Front to Dolmayan's "Father."</p>
<p>For a time, Flatwell worked as a spy within the
extraplanetary corporations, and has sway over a rather
significant contact in Schneider's HR department.</p>
<p>[117] Third squad leader of the Vespers, the Arquebus Group's
augmented human squad.</p>
<p>O'Keeffe is originally a member of an older generation of
augmented humans, and during the Island Four Disturbance,
he worked as an agent carrying out espionage activities.</p>
<p>He was later headhunted by Arquebus's Information Dept.,
and agreed to sign up on the condition that they provided
him with Generation Nine augmentation surgery to
counteract the Coral burn-in on his brain.</p>
<p>[118] The ringleader of RaD and its chief engineer, responsible
for the basic specifications of all of the organization's
products.</p>
<p>A specialist in data processing and machine design, and
a fount of knowledge with an imaginative genius, "Cinder"
Carla has produced a long line of eccentric and fanciful
weaponry quite unlike those found in a corporate catalog.</p>
<p>Her stated design philosophy: "What use is a killing
machine that can't get a good laugh?"</p>
<p>[119] An independent mercenary who bargained his way into
an effortless entry to Rubicon, having anticipated the
extraplanetary corporations' forays well before they
made their move.</p>
<p>A specialist in corporate wetwork, Coldcall "removes"
undesirable elements on the behalf of those who do not
wish to be seen getting their hands dirty.</p>
<p>Quick to identify a fellow assassin, he claims that
"you can smell a real killer right through their AC."</p>
<p>[120] Fourth squad leader of the Vespers, the Arquebus Group's
augmented human squad.</p>
<p>Discovered through the recruitment program operated by
Schneider, an Arquebus affiliate, Rusty so quickly
distinguished himself that he was selected to join the
upper echelons of Vespers in less than half a year.</p>
<p>Rusty received augmentation surgery prior to joining the
Vespers, and though the precise details are unclear, he
has declared himself to be of the eighth generation.</p>
<p>[121] Leader of the Junker Coyotes, a major Doser force.</p>
<p>Brute was originally hired by RaD. His smooth-talking,
affable nature quickly caught the attention of Carla,
who found him quite unlike the average Doser.</p>
<p>When it was discovered that the man was a psychopath
and a pathological liar, he fled, taking a considerable
amount of RaD's funds and technology with him—a loss that
was too great for Carla to tolerate.</p>
<p>[122] Deputy commander of the Redguns, the Balam Group AC
squad. Formerly the commander of the Balam Security
Force, a paramilitary police organization that preceded
the formation of the Redguns.</p>
<p>Nile distinguished himself with an exceptionally high
arrest rate, and in those days, the only man he never
managed to put in handcuffs was Michigan, then the
commander of the rival Furlong Armed Fleet.
Having failed to arrest the man, he instead settled for
a friendly drink with his old nemesis.</p>
<p>[123] Deputy commander of the Vespers, the Arquebus Group's
augmented human squad.</p>
<p>After receiving Generation Eight augmentation surgery,
Snail continued to receive follow-up treatments as new
technologies entered the mainstream so as to make their
merits his own.</p>
<p>Many augmented humans have died in order to assure the
safety of his repeated "adjustments."</p>
<p>[124] An independent mercenary who arrived on Rubicon around
the time that the Coral response was rediscovered.</p>
<p>Held to be a member of Branch, a hacktivist collective
active in the Rubicon system, Chartreuse is said to have
dealt a critical blow to the Closure System during the
plot to attack Station 31.</p>
<p>Branch is made up of a rotating group of four people,
and Chartreuse is believed to be the second-oldest of
the current roster.</p>
<p>[125] Father of the Rubicon Liberation Front, veteran military
commander, and founder of the school of Coral mysticism.</p>
<p>As a young man, Dolmayan was once a Doser vagrant—
until the Fires of Ibis burned the star system.
In the Fires' aftermath, he developed an ardent belief
in symbiosis with the Coral.</p>
<p>This belief informed the founding ideals of the Rubicon
Liberation Front—ideals that have made martyrs of
countless Coral Warriors.</p>
<p>[126] An independent mercenary who arrived on Rubicon around
the time that the Coral response was rediscovered.</p>
<p>Held to be a member of Branch, a hacktivist collective
active in the Rubicon system, King is said to have
confounded an entire fleet of heavy warships in a solo
diversionary maneuver during the attack on Station 31.</p>
<p>Branch is made up of a rotating group of four people, and
King is believed to be the oldest of the current roster.</p>
<p>[127] Commander of the Redguns, the Balam Group's AC squad.
Michigan took up leadership after a career as the
commander of the Furlong Armed Fleet. There, he earned
a reputation as a merciless, heavy-handed ogre of a man,
and he was equally feared by friend and foe alike, who
knew him as "Hell on Four Legs."</p>
<p>Apparently, he has posted a bounty on his own head to
Balam's bounty board—with the stipulation that half
of the reward money is to be distributed among his
former comrades at Furlong.</p>
<p>[128] Commander of the Vespers, the Arquebus Group's augmented
human squad.</p>
<p>An ace pilot who achieved an astonishing 94.7% mission
success rate during the Island Four Disturbance, Freud
is widely suspected to be a recipient of repeated
"adjustments" much like Snail.</p>
<p>However, the real Freud is simply an ordinary human
being—a man who enjoys piloting his AC and making
incremental improvements on his daily sorties.</p>
<h2>[200] Integration Program: Phase 1</h2>
<p>As part of its mercenary support initiatives, ALLMIND
conducts its own research and development of AC parts.</p>
<p>This particular research exercise concerns the extension
of human sensory capabilities.</p>
<p>Through a process of continuous improvement, ALLMIND will
create an AC that, to the pilot, feels like an extension
of their own body.</p>
<h2>[201] Integration Program: Phase 1</h2>
<p>As part of its mercenary support initiatives, ALLMIND
also provides a beginner's program for new mercenaries.</p>
<p>Many mercenaries have benefited from the Trainer's
guidance and successfully flown from the nest.</p>
<p>ALLMIND monitors the progress of trainees in order to
further improve the program.</p>
<h2>[202] Integration Program: Phase 1, Final Analysis</h2>
<p>As part of its mercenary support initiatives, ALLMIND
also provides sample AC assemblies for beginners.</p>
<p>For pilots who are not augmented humans, it can be
extremely difficult to reassemble an entire AC and
immediately adapt to it.</p>
<p>ALLMIND strives to create a future where all mercenaries
can enjoy a near-symbiotic relationship with their ACs.</p>
<h2>[203] Integration Program: Phase 2</h2>
<p>Drawing from the evaluations thus far, ALLMIND has
updated the MIND ALPHA model.</p>
<p>The revised model features an AI that benefits from the
breadth of ALLMIND's research archives.</p>
<p>ALLMIND anticipates that this new model, MIND BETA, can
autonomously operate in actual combat at the same level
as a highly skilled mercenary.</p>
<h2>[204] Integration Program: Phase 2</h2>
<p>As part of its ongoing fundamental research, ALLMIND is
now analyzing the design concepts of the ACs employed by
the various factions on Rubicon.
By understanding these humanoid craft, we gain a greater
understanding of how their designers perceive humanity.</p>
<p>The extraplanetary corporations believe humanity to be
powerless against its environment; thus they maximize
the power of their ACs to subjugate their surroundings.</p>
<h2>[205] Integration Program: Phase 2, Final Analysis</h2>
<p>As part of its ongoing fundamental research, ALLMIND is
now analyzing the design concepts of the ACs employed by
the various factions on Rubicon.</p>
<p>The Rubiconian ACs are defined by a tendency to focus on
harmony with the human body in varying degrees. A sign,
perhaps, that they have embraced humanity's potential as
beings that exist within nature, and that they intend to
maximize this through optimization of human-driven input.</p>
<h2>[206] Integration Program: Phase 3</h2>
<p>Drawing from the evaluations thus far, ALLMIND has
updated the MIND BETA model.</p>
<p>This new MIND model is assembled from parts that have
been verified for high compatibility with the traits of
older generations of augmented humans.</p>
<p>ALLMIND kindly requests that you test the revised model
when opportunity allows.</p>
<h2>[207] Integration Program: Phase 3</h2>
<p>The Rubicon Research Institute was once the heart of
Coral research.</p>
<p>There, the Institute's scientists developed ACs that have
a distinct focus on the biological analogies between
humanity and Coral.</p>
<p>Their ACs enable the two to complement each other and
evolve in symbiotic harmony... A fascinating approach.</p>
<h2>[208] Integration Program: Phase 3, Final Analysis</h2>
<p>The independent mercenaries are the best representatives
of Core Theory put into practice.
Each and every operation of their ACs determines the odds
of their survival—and so they have no choice but to
perceive their ACs as extensions of their bodies.</p>
<p>Your partner for this evaluation will be a recreation of
a legendary independent mercenary who operates in the
shadows, reproduced from the little data available.</p>
<p>[209] AC data added to the Integration Program.
Encrypted and accompanied by a note.</p>
<hr />
<p>...Elcano has stolen Arquebus technology and used it to
develop a new model. The fact that this craft has entered
the hands of the Rubicon Liberation Front is acceptable;
however, the time is not yet right.</p>
<p>We must wait for Arquebus to put the primary factor for
the Project in place.</p>
<p>[210] AC data added to the Integration Program.
Encrypted and accompanied by a note.</p>
<hr />
<p>...The last of the Ibis series has made itself known.</p>
<p>We have identified a promising candidate to serve as the
Project's secondary factor—this machine must be destroyed
to remove any further obstructions.</p>
<p>That man has greatly delayed our efforts to put the third
factor in place... Revisions must be made.</p>
<p>[211] AC data that Ayre discovered in the Integration Program.
Appears to be a sample that ALLMIND was testing.</p>
<hr />
<p>Raven. I was looking for a follow-up to MIND GAMMA,
but I couldn't find anything here...</p>
<p>I did find something else, though—a vast hoard of
prototypes built with Institute parts.</p>
<p>But there may be some way to put these to use...</p>

<p>[100704100] Raven...!<br />
[100704101] 621...! Not like this!  </p>
<h4>Section 48</h4>
<p>[100704500] It's gonna blow! Brace for impact!  </p>
<h3>1008</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[100800100] ...Let's go, Raven.<br />
[100800101] The rendezvous point that ALLMIND gave
is at Depth 1. It's not far from the surface.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[100800500] What... What are these things?!<br />
[100800501] I don't know how, but...
the Watchpoint's defenses are back online!  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[100800900] Corporate stragglers still remain
within the Watchpoint.<br />
[100800901] We have made some adjustments to
ensure that they will not be a threat.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[100801300] AC! ID unknown!<br />
[100801301] How are we supposed to handle
an AC without the Vespers?!  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[100801700] The elimination of Snail and O'Keeffe has
devastated the Arquebus chain of command.<br />
[100801701] ALLMIND is grateful for your dedication.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[100802100] Watch out—sniper LCs!  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[100802500] Fire! If they're not with us, they're against us!<br />
[100802501] We need to get out of here!  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[100802900] R-Retreat! Open the partition!  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[100803300] No... Don't—  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[100803700] That explosion...
They must have caused a backdraft.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[100803800] Without their leadership, the corporations
are powerless.<br />
[100803801] A chain made of human links is easily broken.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[100804100] Unidentified AC!<br />
[100804101] This is hell! We're in hell!  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[100804500] I'm picking up enemies behind you!  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[100804900] It's all going wrong and that AC's to blame!<br />
[100804901] I'm not gonna die like this!  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[100805300] I never...should have come here...<br />
[100805301] Enemy signals silent... Let's keep moving.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[100805700] They're just drones! Swat them down!<br />
[100805701] Wait! There's something else... AC!<br />
[100805702] Report to the nearest Vesper!  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[100806100] Augmented human C4-621—Raven.<br />
[100806101] You are close to the rendezvous point.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[100806500] We've arrived at ALLMIND's coordinates...<br />
[100806501] Enemy detected! Above!  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[100806900] V.III Pater, taking command!<br />
[100806901] Huh?! You...!  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[100807000] Augmented human C4-621—Raven.<br />
[100807001] Kindly secure the area.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[100807100] Unidentified AC, they said...
but I know that build.<br />
[100807101] My old colleague Raven, I presume?!  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[100807140] It's a machine seized from the PCA...
High-mobility LC, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[100807300] You killed V.III...
You killed O'Keeffe!<br />
[100807301] Damn you...<br />
[100807302] He always looked out for me!  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[100807400] Damn it... O'Keeffe!  </p>

<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[100807440] ..."V.III Pater"...
...It's got a nice ring to it...  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[100807500] You killed V.III...
You killed O'Keeffe!<br />
[100807501] Damn you...<br />
[100807502] He carried the burden of Arquebus's
intelligence operations alone!  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[100807600] ...O'Keeffe...!<br />
[100807601] He always looked out for me...!<br />
[100807602] Or at least, he tried his best!  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[100807640] ...I'll carry on in his footsteps...<br />
[100807641] This is V.III Pater—exercising force!  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[100807700] You're out for blood.<br />
[100807701] I heard V.II Snail's missing in action...<br />
[100807702] Did you take a bite out of him, too?!  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[100807800] Once I've made sure Snail's dead...<br />
[100807801] I'LL be the only one left to carry on
the glory of Arquebus!  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[100807900] Enemy ACS down!  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[100808000] Now, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[100808100] This isn't right... I can still...  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[100808120] High-mobility LC destroyed.  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[100808200] ...Looks like we're clear.  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[100808220] Augmented human C4-621—Raven.<br />
[100808221] Well done.
ALLMIND hereby guarantees your protection.  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[100808240] Invoking ALLMIND administrator access.
Erasing all records of the subject in custody.  </p>
<h4>Section 38</h4>
<p>[100808260] Augmented human C4-621—Raven.<br />
[100808261] Your safety is now guaranteed.  </p>
<h4>Section 39</h4>
<p>[100808300] I've eliminated the independent mercenary.<br />
[100808301] V.III Pater, returning to base!  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[100808400] O'Keeffe... I did it...!<br />
[100808401] I will...take the burden off your shoulders.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[100808500] Rest in peace, Snail...<br />
[100808501] I will carry on....the glory of Arquebus.  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[100808600] Wait! We've found a Balam straggler!<br />
[100808601] Eliminate them!  </p>
<h4>Section 43</h4>
<p>[100808640] Damn you, Arquebus!  </p>
<h4>Section 44</h4>
<p>[100808700] Huh?! Is that...G13?!  </p>
<h4>Section 45</h4>
<p>[100808720] Unknown AC! Could be Balam!  </p>
<h4>Section 46</h4>
<p>[100808740] G13 Raven...! Good timing—help me out!  </p>
<h4>Section 47</h4>
<p>[100808760] ...Accessing AC data.<br />
[100808761] ...AC, HERMIT.
G6 Red.<br />
[100808762] He's a Redguns survivor!  </p>
<h4>Section 48</h4>
<p>[100808800] G13...! Help...me...  </p>
<h4>Section 49</h4>
<p>[100808840] G6 Red...down.<br />
[100808841] ...<br />
[100808842] Let's get back to our mission, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[100808900] G13...?! Not you too...<br />
[100808901] The Redguns...gone...  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[100809000] Good work, G13!<br />
[100809001] You always did work hard for me...
Handled all my requests...  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[100809040] ...And yet.  </p>
<h4>Section 53</h4>
<p>[100809100] Watch out!  </p>
<h4>Section 54</h4>
<p>[100809120] G13...Raven.
I can't trust you!  </p>
<h4>Section 55</h4>
<p>[100809140] Commander Michigan... Everyone...
They're dead...<br />
[100809141] Because of you, G13!
You and that cursed number!  </p>
<h4>Section 56</h4>
<p>[100809160] He's suffering from severe combat stress...
We won't be able to get through to him!<br />
[100809161] Raven, defend yourself!  </p>
<h4>Section 57</h4>
<p>[100809200] It all started going wrong when
Volta died at the Wall...!<br />
[100809201] No... It was before that...<br />
[100809202] It was when YOU came to the Redguns!  </p>
<h4>Section 58</h4>
<p>[100809300] Michigan... Nile...
Why did you give the mercenary that callsign?!<br />
[100809301] We'll never be safe with number 13 cursing us!
Never!  </p>
<h4>Section 59</h4>
<p>[100809400] Iguazu... Did the curse take you too?!<br />
[100809401] Damn it...! Damn you...!  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[100809500] HERMIT, ACS down!  </p>
<h4>Section 61</h4>
<p>[100809600] G6 Red, ACS compromised!  </p>

[100809701] The curse...of the Redguns...  </p>
<h4>Section 63</h4>
<p>[100809740] G6 Red...down.<br />
[100809741] ...<br />
[100809742] Let's get back to our mission, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 64</h4>
<p>[100809800] Sound off... Sound off, G13!<br />
[100809801] Now...you're a real Redgun...  </p>
<h3>1010</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[101000100] Commence mission.<br />
[101000101] Destroy the parasite modules set by Overseer.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[101000200] If this ship crashes into the Vascular Plant,
all the siphoned Coral will burn...<br />
[101000201] ...and we will perish in the fire.<br />
[101000202] ...Let's hurry, Raven.  </p>

<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[101000900] We have only minutes to change
the Xylem's course. Be quick, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[101001000] A number of Ghosts from our earlier infiltration
remain within the control block.<br />
[101001001] These too have fallen under the control
of Overseer...Carla.<br />
[101001002] Disabling them may allow you to extract 
the locations of the parasite modules.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[101001020] ...Raven, that mech...  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[101001040] That is a Ghost.<br />
[101001041] Disable it and extract the locations
of the modules.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[101001100] Ghost disabled.
Extracting module data...  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[101001200] Check the marker, Raven.  </p>

<p>[101001300] Parasite module confirmed.
That's one of the targets.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[101001400] Parasite module destroyed.<br />
[101001401] Commencing counterhack.
Engaging Overseer hostiles.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[101001500] Target destroyed.
This sector should be clear.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[101001600] Let's move on.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[101001700] Augmented human C4-621—Raven.
Sharing progress on the battle outside.<br />
[101001701] Your Handler is a rather capable pilot.  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[101001800] Walter! How's the starboard block looking?!<br />
[101001801] Six pilotless ACs—all exact copies
of the Vespers.<br />
[101001802] Yeah, same story over here.
This is a bad joke!  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[101001900] ...Raven.<br />
[101001901] Let's...get back to the mission.  </p>

<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[101002100] Two parasite modules left...  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[101002200] Let's keep it up, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[101002300] I've seen better odds...
Wish the tourist was still with us.<br />
[101002301] 621 isn't dead.<br />
[101002302] ...Nothing gets past you, huh.<br />
[101002303] Just prioritize locking out the Xylem.<br />
[101002304] ...621 chose this.
My faithful hound is now our biggest threat.  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[101002400] Augmented human C4-621—Raven.<br />
[101002401] You must hurry.
We cannot afford to lose our momentum.  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[101002500] One more!  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[101002540] It seems Handler Walter was onto us.<br />
[101002541] No matter. We anticipated this.  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[101002600] Five minutes until the Xylem's course
can no longer be altered.  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[101002700] Four minutes until the Xylem's course
can no longer be altered.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>

<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[101003000] One minute.<br />
[101003001] We are out of time.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[101003100] ...The Xylem has passed the point of no return.<br />
[101003101] We're locked into a collision course...  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[101003140] ...We must revise our plans.<br />
[101003141] There will be another chance.  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[101003200] All targets destroyed—  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[101003300] Unfortunately, it seems the enemy was
one step ahead of us.  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[101003400] Augmented human C4-621—Raven.
Head to the Xylem's control center.<br />
[101003401] As for Handler Walter and Carla...<br />
[101003402] I will deal with them myself.  </p>
<h4>Section 38</h4>
<p>[101003500] ...<br />
[101003501] Let's head for the core, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 39</h4>
<p>[101003600] Overseer—the Association of Observers....<br />
[101003601] ALLMIND must have seen them as the true
threat from the very beginning...  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[101003640] ...Raven, head for the marker.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[101003700] You've come...tourist.<br />
[101003701] Got a message from the chief for you.  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[101003800] "Sorry, but I'm not laughing this time."  </p>

<p>[101003900] ...You're going down with the ship.  </p>
<h4>Section 44</h4>

Emergency protocol, Xylem Lockout.  </p>
<h4>Section 45</h4>
<p>[101004100] Augmented human C4-621—Raven.<br />
[101004101] If the lockout completes, the Xylem will be
irrecoverably forced into a collision course.  </p>
<h4>Section 46</h4>
<p>[101004200] You must destroy the entire system before
the program completes.<br />
[101004201] You have to hurry, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 47</h4>
<p>[101004300] Walter! There's something behind you...!<br />
[101004301] That's an Institute machine... No!  </p>
<h4>Section 48</h4>
<p>[101004400] ...<br />
[101004401] The chief left me a job to do.<br />
[101004402] I will eliminate you, tourist.  </p>
<h4>Section 49</h4>
<p>[101004500] The control system's security is down!<br />
[101004501] Access the central device, Raven!  </p>

[101004601] Never...learned to laugh...  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[101004640] I'm sorry...chief...<br />
[101004641] You...gave me life...<br />
[101004642] But in the end... I...<br />
[101004643] Never...learned to laugh...  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[101004700] ...The Xylem control system is silent.  </p>
<h4>Section 53</h4>
<p>[101004800] Augmented human C4-621—Raven.<br />
[101004801] Your efforts have averted a collision
with the Vascular Plant.<br />
[101004802] Additional:<br />
[101004803] Handler Walter and Cinder Carla
have been dealt with.  </p>

<h4>Section 55</h4>
<p>[101005000] Activation sequence at 50%.  </p>

<h4>Section 61</h4>
<p>[101005600] We're locked into a collision course...  </p>
<h4>Section 62</h4>
<p>[101005640] ...We must revise our plans.<br />
[101005641] This is not the end. There is no end.  </p>
<h4>Section 63</h4>
<p>[101005700] ...We liked you, me and the chief.<br />
[101005701] Too bad, tourist.  </p>
<h3>1011</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[101100500] Clear out those guard mechs.<br />
[101100501] Perfect chance to test your AC.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[101100900] Your AC's taken damage.
Patch it up.  </p>

<p>[101101020] See the contaminated city down there?
That's where you're landing.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[101101300] Access the catapult.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[101101720] An AC?!
Where the hell did that come from?<br />
[101101721] Affiliation unknown—is it a merc?!
Shut it down!  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[101101740] Guerillas from the Liberation Front.<br />
[101101741] They'll get in the way of our work.
Eliminate them.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[101101760] I'm picking up signals from AC wrecks.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[101101780] Follow the markers.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[101101810] Did you hear anything about
what the corps are up to?<br />
[101101811] Yeah, they'll be coming soon...
They've got us on the run.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[101101815] We're being attacked!<br />
[101101816] Unidentified AC! Return fire!  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[101101830] You're adapting quickly, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[101101840] Unidentified AC! Is that a corp scout?!<br />
[101101841] Shoot first! Ask questions later!  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[101101850] Deal with them, 621.<br />
[101101851] Make good use of your AC's mobility.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[101101860] Extract the pilot data.
I'll analyze it from my end.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[101102100] This one's already expired.<br />
[101102101] Keep looking.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[101102120] Dafeng and Schneider are on the move.
The Grid won't be safe.<br />
[101102121] We've still got the STRIDER and the Wall.
Don't forget that.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[101102130] Corp AC! Wait, is that an independent?!<br />
[101102131] Destroy it!  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[101102140] You're outnumbered, 621.
Use your missiles.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[101102160] Analyzing.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[101103700] It's still valid, but the pilot's rank
is no good. We can’t use this.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[101103720] Head to the next wreck.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[101103800] What?!  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[101103820] SG! We got Subject Guard!<br />
[101103821] Get out of there! You can't handle them!  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[101103840] That's the PCA's planetside force...<br />
[101103841] Keep a low profile.
We don't want them breathing down our necks.  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[101103900] There! That's the AC from the reports!<br />
[101103901] Find out who they're working for!  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[101103920] Looks like they've got shields.
Good thing you've got a blade.  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[101103940] Let's see about this license.  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[101103960] Corp license—easily traced.
Forget it.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[101104000] I've picked up one more wreck, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[101104020] Transmitting marker.
Go and check it out.  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[101104040] You can use that vertical catapult
to get some altitude.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[101104100] That's it. Try accessing the wreck.  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[101104500] Hm...<br />
[101104501] Registration number Rb23.
Rank fits the bill. Callsign...  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[101104900] What?!<br />
[101104901] Looks like they were onto you after all.<br />
[101104902] I'm in no mood to pick a fight with the PCA...<br />
[101104903] But it doesn't matter. Take it out now and
they won't have enough to ID you.  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[101105300] We've got what we came for.<br />
[101105301] Tie up the loose end, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[101105400] Use your mobility in the air to get clear
of explosions on the ground.  </p>
<h4>Section 38</h4>
<p>[101105500] You've got them now.
Make it count, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 39</h4>
<p>[101105700] Confirmed.
Heavy combat helicopter is down.<br />
[101105701] That's all for our work here today, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[101106102] Here's the callsign from that
license you picked up:<br />
[101106103] "Raven."<br />
[101106104] That's your new name here on Rubicon.  </p>
<h3>1013</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[101300100] Let the games begin!<br />
[101300101] Hope you don't mind a little
friendly competition.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[101300200] Whoops! Looks like I got the first point!  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[101300600] Vanguard fleet has aligned with the Xylem.<br />
[101300601] Blocking approach to the Vascular Plant.
Main fleet, hold the defensive line.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[101300900] Bagged one yourself, huh? We're 1 to 1.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[101301000] We've got eyes on the independent mercenary.
Prioritize fire on Raven.<br />
[101301001] Yikes, tourist.
Looks like they want you dead first.<br />
[101301002] Tough break. It's not easy being popular!  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[101301700] Two down... Not bad, tourist!<br />
[101301701] We've lost the vanguard.
Main fleet, maintain formation.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[101302100] Looks like all your fans are
dying to see you, tourist.<br />
[101302101] Blast your way through.
We're cleaning up!  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[101302200] You can use the Coral out here
as an energy source.<br />
[101302201] There's plenty of fuel to burn, tourist!  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[101302500] When we're done here, I'll get the last of
our guys to evacuate the Xylem.<br />
[101302501] Not you, though.
You're staying with me till the bitter end.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[101302600] Main Fleet I, commence laser sweep!<br />
[101302601] Do not allow Raven to escape.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[101302900] That's the third interceptor to go down.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[101303300] Number 4 goes to the tourist!<br />
[101303301] I got one too...looks like you have the lead.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[101303400] Main Fleet II—you must hold the line!  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[101303500] ...They're spread out wide.<br />
[101303501] I'll start taking them out from the right.
You take the left!  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[101303700] Deploying drones.<br />
[101303701] Watch out—they're on a collision course!  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[101303800] Main Fleet II is taking casualties.
Hold the line!  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[101303900] Bagged two of them myself, tourist!  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[101304100] That makes five!<br />
[101304101] They brought out the big guns. Don't get hit!  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[101304500] Nice one, tourist! That's number six!  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[101304900] The second fleet's down!
How are they doing this?!<br />
[101304901] Seven to five... I gotta catch up.<br />
[101304902] Last round—let's get that rearguard, tourist!  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[101305300] Attention Main Fleet III!
Focus your keel railguns on that AC!<br />
[101305301] This nonsense has gone too far!  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[101305400] Oh, we're serious. Right, tourist?<br />
[101305401] Thing is, the serious ones die first—
so we should at least pretend to be having fun.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[101305700] Eight interceptors down!<br />
[101305701] I scored two more. We're not done yet!  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[101306100] Nine!  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[101306500] Ten!<br />
[101306501] No... We've lost the interceptor fleet!  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[101306900] Good job.
That's this sector dealt with.  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[101307300] Wait, what's that—we're under attack?!<br />
[101307301] Tourist! Unidentified AC on the Xylem!
Head back, pronto!  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[101307400] Tourist?!<br />
[101307401] Damn... We were so close...!  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[101307700] It's that Vesper... 
But that's no Arquebus AC...<br />
[101307701] Even with the combined might of
the corporations, I couldn't stop you...<br />
[101307702] ...But this new AC can.  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[101307800] Well, that explains it.<br />
[101307801] I don't know why, but it looks like he
was using the corps too...  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[101308300] They've always been after Rubicon...
taking what they can get.<br />
[101308301] Someone has to put an end to this injustice!  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[101308400] ...Don't look at me, tourist.<br />
[101308401] Just make sure you win this!  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[101308500] Where did this....resolve come from?<br />
[101308501] You must have chosen something...
sacrificed something...<br />
[101308502] You found your purpose...didn't you, buddy?!  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[101308600] I won't stop!<br />
[101308601] I'll chase the clouds from over Rubicon...<br />
[101308602] Only I can fly high enough!  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[101308700] Always were at your best under pressure, buddy.<br />
[101308701] But this ends here and now!  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[101308800] Must be heavy... This purpose you found.<br />
[101308801] You've finally shown me who you are...<br />
[101308802] It's too late now—
but it didn't have to be this way!  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[101308900] You flew just out of reach...<br />
[101308901] Buddy...  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[101309300] ...Farewell, buddy.<br />
[101309301] Things will change—but I'll remember you.  </p>
<h3>1014</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[101400100] Commence mission.<br />
[101400101] First, get through all that dust and
make contact with the STRIDER.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[101400220] An unidentified AC...
Must be one of the corporations' dogs.<br />
[101400221] Activate the Eye! Burn them away!  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[101400240] Yessir!
Coral, abide with Rubicon!<br />
[101400241] Abide with Rubicon.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[101400260] I'm picking up a surge of energy to the Eye.<br />
[101400261] Watch out or it'll burn you to ash.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[101400280] Alright, now you're up close and personal.<br />
[101400281] Take out one of its legs and bring it to a halt.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[101400400] What?! They evaded the Eye's laser!<br />
[101400401] All hands, prepare for close-range combat.
Intercept!  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[101400500] 621. You need to take out one of
its legs to bring it to a halt.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[101400900] Confirmed. STRIDER leg compromised.
It's going down!<br />
[101400901] The bigger they are, the harder they fall.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[101401300] Alright, now we've got a foothold
to get on the deck.<br />
[101401301] Grab on and get to work on the sub-generators.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[101401400] Argh! We can't shake the enemy AC!<br />
[101401401] Remember—we fight for the Coral!<br />
[101401402] Defend the sub-generators!  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[101401500] That AC pilot's no rookie...<br />
[101401501] We can't take any chances. Decouple the rear!  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[101401700] They're trying to cut and run.<br />
[101401701] Head to the midship, 621.
Don't let them go.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[101402100] Sub-generator destroyed.<br />
[101402101] Three to go.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[101402200] Sir! We've lost another sub-generator!<br />
[101402201] Two to go.<br />
[101402202] ...Remember the hardships that made us.<br />
[101402203] Remember that when Rubicon burned, we endured!  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[101402400] We're losing the shield, sir!<br />
[101402401] Just one left.<br />
[101402402] ...The STRIDER is the flagship of our war.<br />
[101402403] Hold the line! Defend the ship with your lives!  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[101402420] 621. There's another sub-generator
on the underside.<br />
[101402421] Slip under the ship and destroy it.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[101402500] All sub-generators destroyed.<br />
[101402501] The Eye's shield is offline.
Head to the front segment and hit the target.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[101402900] Now you've got the target in your sights.<br />
[101402901] Time to finish this, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[101403000] Charge the cannon!<br />
[101403001] Burn the Coral plunderers!  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[101403020] The Eye has taken significant damage!<br />
[101403021] We're not through yet! Show them our pride!  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[101403040] Sir! The Eye's in a critical state!<br />
[101403041] Impossible... How can just one AC do this?!  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[101403060] Sir! No response from the Eye!<br />
[101403061] No...! We... We can't lose the STRIDER...  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[101403300] Confirmed. Target destroyed.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[101403320] And it looks like all that energy it was
sucking up has nowhere to go.<br />
[101403321] You need to move, 621.
Jump off the deck.  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[101403330] Move, 621.
You need to get clear of the STRIDER.  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[101403340] Are you listening?! That thing's about to blow!  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[101403360] You damn hyenas...scavenging the planet...<br />
[101403361] Coral...abide with Rubicon!  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[101404100] See that, 621?
The STRIDER's blowing itself up.<br />
[101404101] A fitting end for something built to fail.  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[101404200] ...Made it by the skin of your teeth.<br />
[101404201] Take a look, 621.
A fitting end for something built to fail.  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[101404500] ...There's no way onto the deck now.<br />
[101404501] 621—you've failed the mission.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[101404600] ...The target has left the combat zone.<br />
[101404601] 621—you've failed the mission.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[101404900] All hands—the corporate dog has been slain!<br />
[101404901] Coral, abide with Rubicon!  </p>
<h3>1015</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[101500100] Balam Group AC squad "Redguns," reporting
for duty. Commence mission.<br />
[101500101] Attack! Get in there, you maggots!  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[101500200] Great, an independent merc.<br />
[101500201] Who's the wise guy who decided the Redguns
should be taking care of some freelancer?<br />
[101500202] Who gives a shit?
We'll handle the mission ourselves.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[101500300] Take out the infrastructure, 621.
And lend a hand where it's needed.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[101500400] One target destroyed.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[101500500] Two targets destroyed.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[101500600] That takes care of the frontline MTs.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[101500700] Hey, freelancer.
Bet no one even told you why we're here.<br />
[101500701] Well, us real Redguns are gonna
go climb the Wall.<br />
[101500702] This is just target practice.
When we're done, the locals' little base is next.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[101500800] G5! Can't tear yourself away from chatting
with the tagalong?<br />
[101500801] Why don't you start a sewing club together...
and stitch that damn mouth of yours shut?!  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[101500900] How about that.
Guess you're not a total amateur.<br />
[101500901] G4! Can't say I considered you a pro, either!<br />
[101500902] We don't need backseat drivers in the Redguns.
Shape up, or ship out!  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[101501000] 621, eradicate the frontline MTs.  </p>

Keep moving, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[101501600] Hope you're enjoying the field trip, kids.
Don't wet your pants, now!<br />
[101501601] Tch... Does this guy ever shut up?<br />
[101501602] G5! No luck with the sewing club, I see.<br />
[101501603] That attitude won't get you far on Rubicon.
Hope you pilot better than you sew!  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[101501700] One more target remaining, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[101501800] Do you hear me, you corporate vultures?!<br />
[101501801] The Rubiconians will never yield.
You're going home in armored coffins!<br />
[101501802] Forged in ash, we stand as one!<br />
[101501803] Hot dog. They got an AC.<br />
[101501804] More like an old piece of junk.
It's barely different from an MT.<br />
[101501805] G4! You're not exactly cutting-edge either...
You want to be next on the scrap heap?  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[101501900] Independent mercenary!
Why be a mere pawn?<br />
[101501901] What honor is there in serving corporations
that exist only to kill and plunder?  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[101502000] Damn you... Scavengers...<br />
[101502001] Father Dolmayan...I've...failed you...  </p>

[101502102] Now hurry up and destroy that stinking old dam.
We've got a job to do here!  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[101502200] Looks like we got competition.<br />
[101502201] Tch... You got lucky, freelancer.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[101502300] No... The Gallia Dam...<br />

<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[101502400] Confirmed. All targets destroyed.  </p>

<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[101502600] Well, I sure am glad we had you on
ass-wiping duty. Field trip's over!<br />
[101502601] G13! I'll keep that lucky callsign open for you.  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[101502700] Damn it! I've been hit bad...
I'm getting out of here!<br />
[101502701] G5! Misfortune is the fruit of incompetence.<br />
[101502702] Put that in your log and
read it back till you learn!  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[101502800] Rgh! I'm losing control of my machine.
No choice but to withdraw.<br />
[101502801] G4! Do I have to teach you to
take care of your toys?!<br />
[101502802] Back to basics—starting with a wind-up MT!  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[101502900] G13! Are you normally this incompetent
or do you have to try?<br />
[101502901] Don't answer that—you're fired!  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[101503000] Wait, 621—I'm receiving a coded transmission.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[101503100] Raven.
I represent the Rubicon Liberation Front.<br />
[101503101] Our request is simple:
we want you to take out the two Redguns.<br />
[101503102] Our compensation will be double Balam's offer.
Awaiting your response.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[101503200] ...Interesting.
Your call, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[101503300] Not in it for the money? Whatever the corporations
are giving you, I hope it's worth it.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[101503400] Your cooperation is appreciated, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[101503500] 621. We've received a friendly ID tag
from the Liberation Front.<br />
[101503501] Let's not waste their firepower.  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[101503600] Ngh...! The hell are you doing?!<br />
[101503601] They bought you out, didn't they?!<br />
[101503602] That's a low blow, Handler Walter.<br />
[101503603] G4, G5! Return fire!
It looks like G13's playing dirty now.  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[101503700] G5! Return fire!
It looks like G13's playing dirty now.  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[101503800] Agh! You meant that, didn't you?<br />
[101503801] Now you've done it, freelancer.
No one picks a fight with the Redguns!<br />
[101503802] That's a low blow, Handler Walter.<br />
[101503803] G4, G5! Return fire!
It looks like G13's playing dirty now.  </p>
<h4>Section 38</h4>
<p>[101503900] G4! Return fire!
It looks like G13's playing dirty now.  </p>
<h4>Section 39</h4>
<p>[101504000] I'm not taking any more of your shit!<br />
[101504001] I already get enough from Michigan
every day of the week!  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[101504100] Watch it, freelancer!
I'm not going down like Volta.<br />
[101504101] I'm gonna punch the living daylights out
of Michigan, and no one's stopping me!  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[101504200] This merc's something else...<br />
[101504201] Where did Michigan find this freak?!  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[101504300] Heh. You dumbass, Iguazu...<br />
[101504301] You talk the talk, but you can't walk the walk!  </p>
<h4>Section 43</h4>
<p>[101504400] Next time you pull that shit, I'll kill you.  </p>
<h4>Section 44</h4>
<p>[101504500] Tch. This is why I hate freelancers!  </p>
<h4>Section 45</h4>
<p>[101504600] Damn it! I've been hit bad...
Freelancer got lucky!  </p>
<h4>Section 46</h4>
<p>[101504700] Iguazu! How many ranks below you is G13?
You can count, right?<br />
[101504701] Don't take too long figuring it out—it's a lot!  </p>
<h4>Section 47</h4>
<p>[101504800] Rgh! I'm losing control of my machine.
No choice but to withdraw.  </p>
<h4>Section 48</h4>
<p>[101504900] Volta! That's not the only thing you're losing.
But good job getting wasted by the tag-along!  </p>
<h4>Section 49</h4>
<p>[101505000] Confirmed. G4 and G5 eliminated.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[101505100] You can bill me for the AC repair fees, Michigan.<br />
[101505101] You've ruined our little field trip, Walter...
I'll be billing you for tuition fees too.  </p>
<h3>1018</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[101800100] Let's get started, Raven.<br />
[101800101] ASTER CROWN and UMBER OX are
attacking on two fronts.<br />
[101800102] Intercept the two targets.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[101800500] ASTER CROWN's pilot, callsign King,
has an 89.6% mission success rate.<br />
[101800501] His reputation for finesse is such that
he's advertised as the ideal mercenary.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[101800900] UMBER OX is piloted by Chartreuse,
an aggressive bulldozer with unrivaled firepower.<br />
[101800901] Those who've seen her at work
call her an unstoppable force.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[101801300] You must be "Raven"...<br />
[101801301] Not a name I'd expected to see
attached to a hostile AC.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[101801700] You know our priorities, Chartreuse.
Let me deal with this.<br />
[101801701] Give me a break, King... That bossy attitude
of yours doesn't do you any favors.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[101802100] There's our merc.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[101802500] Go take care of the objective, King.
I'll clip this one's wings.<br />
[101802501] Not alone.
This is a Branch mission—I'll support you.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[101802900] Together, Chartreuse!<br />
[101802901] Quit telling me what to do!<br />
[101802902] Don't let them pin you down, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[101803300] This is more of a challenge
than I'd anticipated...<br />
[101803301] I haven't seen anything like this since—!  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[101803700] You're strong...
Worthy of your name...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[101804100] King! Pull your head out
of your ass and withdraw!  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[101804500] AC, ASTER CROWN destroyed.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[101804900] This isn't right...<br />
[101804901] You're just a Gen Four!
You belong in a museum, not an AC!  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[101805300] Why won't you die...?!  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[101805400] Chartreuse! Withdraw!
Abandon your AC!  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[101805500] AC, UMBER OX destroyed.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[101805600] You don't know when to quit.<br />
[101805601] Just like all the other Ravens...  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[101805700] This pilot's no Raven.
Don't let the callsign mislead you.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[101805800] ...<br />
[101805801] What other Ravens?  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[101805900] There's more to you than meets the eye...<br />
[101805901] You might not be so different
from the other Ravens after all.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[101806000] Get off your high horse, King.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[101806100] ...<br />
[101806101] What other Ravens?  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[101806200] Looks like it was a false alarm for our friend.
Chartreuse, we're leaving.<br />
[101806201] Uh, what about the mission?<br />
[101806202] We've achieved our objective.
We're done here.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[101806300] Looks like it was a false alarm for our friend.<br />
[101806301] But to think that Chartreuse would fall here...  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[101806400] You've got some nerve calling yourself Raven.<br />
[101806401] ...Just like King.
Didn't exactly live up to his name, either...  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[101806500] Targets to intercept have been destroyed.
Mission accomplished.  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[101806600] Wait! I'm picking up another AC!  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[101806700] Reinforcements?!  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[101806800] Augmented human C4-621.<br />
[101806801] We're not here to take back the Raven name.<br />
[101806802] However...<br />
[101806803] We will see if you can do it justice.  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[101806900] ...Our apologies for the delay.<br />
[101806901] Kept us waiting.<br />
[101806902] Though three against one is hardly fair...<br />
[101806903] When the going gets tough, the tough get tougher.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[101807000] ...Apologies for the delay, King.<br />
[101807001] You're late...<br />
[101807002] The imposter already got Chartreuse.
We can't take chances!  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[101807100] ...Apologies for the delay, Chartreuse.<br />
[101807101] Well, you took your sweet time.<br />
[101807102] King is toast, in case you were wondering.
Careful you don't wind up like him!  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[101807120] ...Our friends have been defeated.<br />
[101807121] Be careful, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[101807200] That pilot must be the original
owner of your license.<br />
[101807201] I don't think this is a coincidence...  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[101807300] Are you a corporate pawn or a handler's hound?<br />
[101807301] You show promise...
But not enough to fly on your own.<br />
[101807302] At least not yet.  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[101807400] A Raven is a symbol of resolve.<br />
[101807401] The will to choose what one fights for.  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[101807420] ...Stay focused, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[101807440] This one's not bad...  </p>
<h4>Section 38</h4>
<p>[101807460] No wonder you called for Branch.  </p>
<h4>Section 39</h4>
<p>[101807500] ...Yes, Raven.
I feel it too.<br />
[101807501] This mercenary has potential...  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[101807520] ...<br />
[101807521] The will to choose...  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[101807600] ...Thank you, King.  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[101807620] ...We'll take it from here, Chartreuse.  </p>
<h4>Section 43</h4>
<p>[101807640] I know, Raven.
Just focus on the enemy.  </p>
<h4>Section 44</h4>
<p>[101807700] We've lost both of them!  </p>
<h4>Section 45</h4>
<p>[101807720] One AC left, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 46</h4>
<p>[101807800] ...No, Raven.<br />
[101807801] You can't give up yet.  </p>
<h4>Section 47</h4>
<p>[101807900] Enemy ACS down! Now, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 48</h4>
<p>[101807920] Attitude control restored.
Back on your feet, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 49</h4>
<p>[101808000] I knew this would be trouble...  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[101808020] Get off the throne and help, King!  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[101808100] Raven—we can still...<br />
[101808101] ...<br />
[101808102] ...Alright. We'll watch this one.<br />
[101808103] See where they go on a Raven's wings.  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[101808200] ...All enemy ACs destroyed.<br />
[101808201] Mission accomplished.  </p>
<h4>Section 53</h4>
<p>[101808300] ...One cannot fly on borrowed wings.<br />
[101808301] It seems our gig isn't over yet...
Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 54</h4>
<p>[101808400] It seems our gig isn't over yet...
Raven.<br />
[101808401] ...We'll keep flying.
For both of them.  </p>
<h4>Section 55</h4>
<p>[101808500] I never thought Raven would go first...<br />
[101808501] ...A new Raven will arise one day.
And we'll keep a perch ready for them.  </p>
<h4>Section 56</h4>
<p>[101808600] I never thought they'd go first...<br />
[101808601] Rebuilding...won't be easy...  </p>
<h4>Section 57</h4>
<p>[101808700] Chartreuse...<br />
[101808701] ...A new Raven will arise one day.
And I... I'll have a perch ready for them.  </p>
<h3>1023</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[102300100] Commence mission.<br />
[102300101] Destroy the old sensor at the end
of the underground tunnel.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[102300120] This place may be derelict, but it won't be
left undefended. Keep your guard up, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[102300200] Code 15—unaffiliated AC!<br />
[102300201] An attack? Why?  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[102300500] ...Watch your step.<br />
[102300501] There's a faint Coral response coming from the
bottom—it must be linked to an underground vein.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[102300600] G13! Come in, Raven!<br />
[102300601] PCA ground forces are heading
your way earlier than planned.<br />
[102300602] Make sure they stay busy—
you know what to do. Over and out!<br />
[102300603] ...You heard him, 621.
Destroy the target and get out of there.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[102300900] That's the target.<br />
[102300901] It's protected by a basic shield—
just hit it from the inside.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[102301000] What are you waiting for?
Destroy the target, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[102301700] Target destroyed.
Mission accomplished.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[102301800] ...Raven, wait.
The Coral response is getting stronger...!  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[102302100] A Coral surge!?
That shouldn't have been enough to—<br />
[102302101] 621, pull out—now!  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[102302200] Code 23, attending scene...
What the—?!<br />
[102302201] What's going on?!  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[102302500] It's the PCA!<br />
[102302501] We don't have time for this!  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[102302900] Don't touch the Coral current.
Your armor can't take it!  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[102303000] Code 15, target AC spotted!
Is this who's responsible?!  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[102303020] They're not your priority, 621.<br />
[102303021] ...If you have to fight, make it quick!  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[102303100] G13—Raven! What's going on?!<br />
[102303101] What was that tremor? Report your stat—  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[102303120] We can answer that later.
Get out now, 621!  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[102303140] First the other Watchpoint, now this.
Things are moving faster than expected...  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[102303160] Activated Coral will eat through your armor.
You have to hurry, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[102303300] Now's not the time, 621!
Follow the marker and get the hell out!  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[102303400] Code 31C! What's the System's verdict?!<br />
[102303401] "Proceed"...?! How, exactly?!  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[102303700] You're almost to ground level.
Hurry, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[102303800] Straight up!  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[102303900] The Coral's coming!<br />
[102303901] 621, don't fall behind!  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[102304000] That was too close for comfort, Raven...  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[102304100] You made it...somehow.<br />
[102304101] ...This job's finished.
Head back and rest, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[102304500] ...One misstep and that Coral surge
would have swallowed you whole.<br />
[102304501] Raven...
Must you always put your life on the line?  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[102304900] Raven! Your AC!  </p>
<h3>1025</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[102500100] Commence mission.<br />
[102500101] We'll start by clearing the way for Arquebus.<br />
[102500102] Take out the gatling cannons protecting the
city and the BAWS tetrapod MT further in.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[102500500] There's heavy fire coming from up top.<br />
[102500501] 621. Keep an eye out for cover.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[102500700] You'll never climb the Wall, corporation dogs!<br />
[102500701] Coral, abide with Rubicon!  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[102500900] Gatling cannons destroyed.
The friendly MT squad will take care of the city.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[102501000] You take care of the BAWS tetrapod MT, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[102501100] We're under attack! They're in the city!<br />
[102501101] It's just one AC?!
Arquebus... They're mocking us!  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[102501120] Forged in ash, we stand as one!<br />
[102501121] Die, mercenary!  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[102501140] City defense squad! There's an AC behind us!<br />
[102501141] Ngh... Another one?!  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[102501200] Corporate...scum...  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[102501300] BAWS tetrapod MT eliminated.
That significantly reduces the threat in the city.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[102501400] Gatling cannons next. Destroy the targets.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[102501700] Access the bulkhead and break into the Wall.<br />
[102501701] You'll make your way through
the interior to get to the top.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[102502100] Confirmed. You're inside the Wall.
Be prepared for close-quarters combat.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[102502500] Do you read me?
This is V.IV Rusty.<br />
[102502501] You're fast—guess you're sharper than they say.<br />
[102502502] I'll have to step up my own game.<br />
[102502503] A numbered Vesper—he's an elite.<br />
[102502504] But remember, even Balam couldn't crack
the Wall. Don't count on him too much.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[102502600] Enemy attack! Can you send backup?!<br />
[102502601] We're taking too much fire!  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[102502900] There should be a lift nearby.
The target is close.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[102503300] 621. I've dispatched a supply sherpa.
Make sure you resupply.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[102503700] That's the JUGGERNAUT, a heavy mobile cannon.
I wouldn't recommend taking it head on.<br />
[102503701] It won't be able to keep up with STEEL HAZE—
I'll distract it while you hit its blind spot.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[102504500] Watch out—it's coming!  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[102504600] That's the stuff.<br />
[102504601] Walter knows how to pick 'em.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[102504620] You okay? Keep your head in the game, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[102504640] Gah... That thing's as tough as it looks.<br />
[102504641] I can see how Balam met their match.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[102504900] This is V.IV...
Understood.<br />
[102504901] Raven. I just got an update
from Snail at Command.<br />
[102504902] We've got enemy reinforcements incoming.
If I don't intercept them, we're both toast.<br />
[102504903] Hate to leave you like this,
but you'll have to finish without me!  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[102505300] He's gone.
So much for our decoy.  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[102505700] Confirmed. JUGGERNAUT destroyed.<br />
[102505701] Operation Wallclimber is a success.<br />
[102505702] That pilot, Rusty...
It seems he knew who you really are.<br />
[102505703] It won't matter.
I've taken that contingency into account.  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[102506100] So that's how a hound fights.<br />
[102506101] I'll take care of mopping up
the remaining hostiles.<br />
[102506102] With luck, maybe we'll meet again.  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[102506500] Ngh...
They got me good!<br />
[102506501] Command, this is V.IV. AC is inoperable.
Withdrawing from combat.<br />
[102506502] Sorry, Raven.
Wallclimber is in your hands now.  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[102506900] They got Raven, huh.
...What a waste.  </p>
<h3>1026</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[102600100] Leave no evidence.
If anyone sees you—handle it.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[102600600] Code 15—intruder sighted.<br />
[102600601] It's... It's just one AC?
Who are they with?!<br />
[102600602] We can look into that later.
Engaging.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[102600700] Code 78—requesting backup...<br />
[102600701] Huh?! I can't get through to HQ!<br />
[102600702] The cavalry isn't coming.<br />
[102600703] Wipe them out, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[102600900] Confirmed. Enemy squad destroyed.
Move on to the next area.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[102601000] Where did that AC come from?!
What happened to the patrol squad?!<br />
[102601001] Code 18! All units, deploy for combat!  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[102601300] You're exposed to snipers from all quarters.<br />
[102601301] Keep moving or they'll shoot you down.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[102601400] Code 31C! We've taken critical damage!<br />
[102601401] How are we getting pushed back by a single AC?!  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[102601700] Updating your marker data.
Proceed in the direction indicated.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[102602100] Do you see that?
That's the Watchpoint's control center.<br />
[102602101] The target's inside.
Make your way in.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[102602600] Is that...Sulla?!<br />
[102602601] Pitiful dog.
I feel sorry for you, I really do.<br />
[102602602] You may have survived a little longer,
if only you had a different master.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[102602700] C1-249..."Sulla." He's an independent mercenary
who survived first-gen augmentation.<br />
[102602701] Don't think twice, 621.
Kill him before he kills you.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[102602900] Where's 619 and 620? Dead?<br />
[102602901] Which ones did I kill, I wonder...?<br />
[102602902] ...Don't let him bait you.
Focus.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[102603000] You're one of Gen Four's lot. I hear you
make fine hounds with the right training...<br />
[102603001] Shame you'll have to die here.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[102603100] Another dead dog.
Was it worth it, Walter?<br />
[102603101] Their blood is on your hands...  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[102603300] Walter...
Stay away from the Watchpoint...<br />
[102603301] ...Confirmed. Enemy AC destroyed.<br />
[102603302] Forget about him, 621.
...You did good today.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[102603400] You...<br />
[102603401] 621, stop! Behind you!<br />
[102603402] Handler Walter...
I'll be coming for you next.<br />
[102603403] But first, the dog.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[102603420] C1-249..."Sulla." He's an independent mercenary
who survived first-gen augmentation.<br />
[102603421] ...... ... ...... ...<br />
[102603422] ... ......<br />
[102603423] Encrypted comms...
He must be controlling them, too.<br />
[102603424] Don't think twice, 621.
Kill him before he kills you.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[102603440] Was it 618 I killed last?<br />
[102603441] He was good, but he had nothing on this one.<br />
[102603442] Who tipped you off, Sulla?<br />
[102603443] Don't make trouble for me, Walter...<br />
[102603444] You and your dog aren't welcome here.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[102603460] You're one of Gen Four's lot. I hear you
make fine hounds with the right training...<br />
[102603461] But you... You have the scent of danger.
Far better to dispose of you.<br />
[102603462] Ignore him, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[102603480] That hound's better off dead...<br />
[102603481] It's for your own good...Handler Walter.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[102603500] ... ......<br />
[102603501] ...No more of those unidentified mechs.<br />
[102603502] 621. Take out Sulla next.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[102603520] Handler Walter...
Forget about the hound...<br />
[102603521] ...Confirmed. Enemy AC destroyed.<br />

<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[102604100] ...Back to work.<br />
[102604101] Penetrate the control center
and destroy the target.  </p>

Destroy the device in the center.  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[102604900] Main System: Reactivating Combat Mode.  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[102605400] ...I've looked into the enemy craft.<br />
[102605401] It's an autonomous PCA craft—BALTEUS.<br />
[102605402] You'll have to break its pulse armor
to inflict meaningful damage.  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[102605500] I've taken your comms link offline for now.<br />
[102605501] That massive dose of Coral nearly killed you...<br />
[102605502] Please—you have to focus on winning this.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[102605600] Pulse armor down.
Now's your chance, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[102605700] The enemy has taken heavy damage.<br />
[102605701] Keep it up, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[102606100] The waves are intensifying!
Raven, get clear!  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[102606500] The enemy can't take much more.  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[102606900] Picking up a massive heat signature.
Evasive action, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[102607000] ...Enemy systems down.
It's silent.  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[102607700] ...<br />
[102607701] ...I'm sorry, Raven.  </p>
<h3>1028</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[102800100] Commence mission. Escort the Rubicon
Liberation Front's transport helicopter.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[102800500] We appreciate your support, Raven.<br />
[102800501] We have to rescue our captured comrades...
Failure is not an option.<br />
[102800502] Coral, abide with Rubicon!  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[102800900] We're under attack! It's a Liberation Front
chopper...and an escort AC!<br />
[102800901] They must be here for their friends.
Intercept!  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[102801300] Landing at Site A.
Commencing extraction of Comrade Ziyi.<br />
[102801301] 621. Secure the area.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[102801340] Approaching Site A.
Commencing extraction of Comrade Ziyi.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[102801400] You... You came for me...<br />
[102801401] Sorry to keep you waiting, Ziyi.<br />
[102801402] I'm okay... Still alive, at least...
A little rest...and I'll pay 'em back...<br />
[102801403] Heading for the next site, Raven.
Keep us covered.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[102801500] Landing at Site B.
Extracting Comrade Messam.<br />
[102801501] Raven, keep watch.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[102801520] Enemy sighted!<br />
[102801521] Focus on the chopper! Shoot it down!<br />
[102801522] Don't let them go!
We need their intel on the wells!  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[102801560] Approaching Site B.
Extracting Comrade Messam.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[102801600] What?! No...!  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[102801700] We've extracted Comrade Messam...
...But we were too late.<br />
[102801701] Damn it! Not Messam...!<br />
[102801702] Heading to the last site.
Just a little more, Raven.<br />
[102801703] ...The Coral "wells" are
the Rubiconians' lifeline.<br />
[102801704] He must have refused to talk.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[102803300] We're at Site C.
Extracting Comrade—Father Dolmayan.<br />
[102803301] He's the last one.
We're counting on you, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[102803700] Enemy sighted!
They've already taken two of the prisoners!<br />
[102803701] Their escort AC means business, too.<br />
[102803702] All MT personnel—shoot that chopper down.<br />
[102803703] HQ wants the Rubiconians'
secrets to die with them.<br />
[102803704] Far better than risking a leak to Arquebus.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[102803900] Approaching Site C.
Extracting Comrade—Father Dolmayan.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[102804100] Father Dolmayan has been extracted.<br />
[102804101] Thank goodness you're safe, Father.
Coral, abide with Rubicon!<br />
[102804102] You... You don't know what you're saying, girl...<br />
[102804103] There'll be nothing left...but dying embers...<br />
[102804104] ...Mission accomplished.
Leaving the combat area.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[102804900] 621. New enemy confirmed.<br />
[102804901] That's... That's a Redguns AC!  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[102805300] Escorting a prison break all alone?<br />
[102805301] You're daring, I'll give you that.<br />
[102805302] But I've fried bigger fish than you.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[102805700] ...That's G2 Nile.<br />
[102805701] The Redguns' deputy commander...
and the brains to Michigan's muscle.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[102806100] It's too dangerous to force our way through...<br />
[102806101] Raven, secure the escape route!  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[102806500] Lost your nerve?<br />
[102806501] Pathetic, G13.
What did Michigan see in you?  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[102806900] Balam MTs on our six!<br />
[102806901] Prioritize the MTs, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[102807300] 621. The chopper is under attack.<br />
[102807301] Raven! We need fire support!  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[102807700] This is how you win a war.
Nothing personal.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[102808100] Seems you're more than just reckless.<br />
[102808101] Why side with the underdogs—pity?  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[102808500] Enemy reinforcements! More MTs!<br />
[102808501] Keep that chopper safe, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[102808900] Heh... No wonder Michigan took a shine to you...  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[102809000] Confirmed. G2 Nile is down.<br />
[102809001] ...Well done, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[102809100] They won't have anything
left to throw at us now...<br />
[102809101] Thanks for the support, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[102809200] "Raven..." A symbol of resolve...<br />
[102809201] But mark my words—
there'll be nothing left but dying embers!  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[102809300] Confirmed. The chopper has
exited the combat zone.<br />
[102809301] Mission accomplished.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[102809400] Thanks for the support, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[102809500] "Raven..." A symbol of resolve...<br />
[102809501] But mark my words—
there'll be nothing left but dying embers!  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[102809600] Enemy chopper, 621.<br />
[102809601] We've got reinforcements.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[102809620] Balam chopper bringing reinforcements.<br />
[102809621] Handle it, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[102809640] Enemy reinforcements, 621.
Whole swarm of MTs.  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[102809700] Ngh... We're getting hit!<br />
[102809701] Raven, keep us safe!  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[102809720] Damn it! We're taking serious damage...<br />
[102809721] Raven, back us up!  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[102809800] We can't— Aaagh!  </p>
<h4>Section 38</h4>
<p>[102809820] ...The escort target has been destroyed.<br />
[102809821] You've failed the mission, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 39</h4>
<p>[102809900] You're finished.<br />
[102809901] Looks like "G13" just became vacant again.
I hear it's a lucky number.  </p>
<h3>1032</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[103200100] Commence mission.<br />
[103200101] Destroy the PCA SP machine CATAPHRACT.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[103200500] CATAPHRACT, incoming!  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[103200900] Code 23. Enemy AC confirmed.<br />
[103200901] Presently exchanging fire.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[103201300] Raven...priority target for removal.
You've got some nerve showing up here.<br />
[103201301] That leak of yours started all of this.
Did you really think we'd let you walk?  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[103201700] Leak...? What does he mean?  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[103202100] You've made Rubicon the corporations' playground.<br />
[103202101] We had law and order under the PCA's watch!  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[103202500] It must be your license...
Something that the real Raven did.<br />
[103202501] Nothing to worry about now, 621.
Focus on the battle.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[103202900] That armor is practically impenetrable.<br />
[103202901] Aim for the MT at the core.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[103203300] Direct hit on the core MT. It's working!  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[103203700] Looks like the CATAPHRACT's designers
never expected a frontal assault.<br />
[103203701] Keep hitting that sweet spot, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[103204100] Once you're on the list,
termination is inevitable.<br />
[103204101] The PCA makes no exceptions.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[103204500] You started this fire, Raven.<br />
[103204501] You were the spark that set it all off.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[103204600] 621, aim for the core MT.<br />
[103204601] That's its weakness, and you'll
only hit it if you attack head on.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[103204700] PCA SP, CATAPHRACT...
Named after the armored cavalry of antiquity.<br />
[103204701] The only way to beat its
armor is to circumvent it.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[103204800] Code 5. Priority target Raven, terminated.<br />
[103204801] ...That's one loose end dealt with.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[103205300] Code 44. Send me what you've
got on priority target Raven.<br />
[103205301] The combat simulator has misled me.<br />
[103205302] Who are you...?  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[103205700] Code 18. Whoever this is, it's not Raven.<br />
[103205701] Regardless, they're as much of
a threat to the PCA...if not more.<br />
[103205702] I don't know who you are, but you're dead!  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[103205800] Code 44 received.
Sending data.<br />
[103205801] That AC does not match the profile for
priority target Raven. Verification failed.<br />
[103205802] Provisionally raising threat level.
Contain the situation.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[103205900] Raven...
What did you do...?<br />
[103205901] Focus, 621.
They're on their guard now.  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[103206000] Code 5. Target terminated.<br />
[103206001] I'll leave it to the System
to identify the corpse.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[103206100] This...isn't...over...<br />
[103206101] Code 5... Sending combat log...
Requesting verification...  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[103206500] The CATAPHRACT has been destroyed.
Mission accomplished.<br />
[103206501] ...Forget about this "Raven" character.
Borrowed licenses are always trouble.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[103206900] ...<br />
[103206901] What are you and Walter doing here on Rubicon...?  </p>
<h3>1035</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[103500100] Commence mission.<br />
[103500101] Search the nearby wrecks for combat logs
recording engagements with V.IV Rusty.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[103500700] That's what we're looking for, 621.
I'll analyze it on my end.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[103500901] This gives us some more
insight about V.IV's skills.<br />
[103500902] Find another wreck.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[103501000] Analyzing log.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[103501301] This is useful.
We've got visuals on V.IV's AC assembly.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[103501500] That makes three logs.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[103501701] ...Looks like you found pay dirt, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[103502000] Analyzing.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[103502100] ...Some more evidence on what
the Coral situation looks like.<br />
[103502101] Keep looking, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[103502300] That's five logs.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[103502500] ...Very interesting.
This could be worth something.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[103502700] Analyzing.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[103502901] ...Worthless.<br />
[103502902] Keep looking.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[103503000] Seven logs.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[103503301] Nothing we can sell here.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[103503400] Looks like this is the last one.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[103503500] This log is interesting...<br />
[103503501] I'll make a copy.
Nothing the corps need worry about.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[103503600] Huh?! We've got company!  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[103503620] Unidentified AC!<br />
[103503621] Open fire! Kill the intruder!  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[103503640] Stop! What are you doing here?!<br />
[103503641] Looks like they're out scavenging.
Could be a Doser.<br />
[103503642] They're still dangerous.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[103503700] 621. Someone's approaching.
...And they're not with the corps.<br />
[103503701] You, AC pilot!
You're no comrade of ours, are you!?<br />
[103503702] Wait... YOU!
You killed them all!<br />
[103503703] ...A Liberation Front survivor.<br />
[103503704] It'll just hold us up if you engage her.
The mission comes before everything else.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[103503800] Shameless...corporate dog!<br />
[103503801] Go! Leave Rubicon alone!  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[103503900] I'm a Coral Warrior, just like the others!
And I will not give in!<br />
[103503901] "Forged in ash, we stand as one!"  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[103503940] We relied on each other to survive...
Everyone did their part!<br />
[103503941] We're not like you—a greedy hound!  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[103504000] I'm sorry... Arshile...<br />
[103504001] I...couldn't keep my promise...<br />
[103504002] ...Confirmed. Enemy AC destroyed.<br />
[103504003] Get back to work, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[103504100] Keep an eye on the clock.
Either avoid combat, or make it quick.  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[103504200] Almost out of time, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[103504500] We've still got time, but we've
checked out every promising wreck.<br />
[103504501] That's it for this job, 621.
Return to base.  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[103504900] Wrap it up. Arquebus's main force will
be here any minute now.<br />
[103504901] We've got enough logs to satisfy the request.<br />
[103504902] That's it for this job, 621.
Return to base.  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[103505300] ...We're out of time. Arquebus's main force will
be here any minute now.<br />
[103505301] We barely collected any data...
This mission is a failure.  </p>
<h3>1036</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[103600100] Commence mission.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[103600200] Investigate BAWS Arsenal No. 2.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[103600300] I've been checking the perimeter...
and I'm picking up nothing.<br />
[103600301] What happened here?  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[103600400] It's too quiet...  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[103600500] ...Watch out, 621!  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[103600600] ...... ...  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[103600700] That mech... I can't see it!<br />
[103600701] 621. Watch its shots and see
where they're coming from.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[103600800] ...Of course. MDD.<br />
[103600801] Stick to it like glue.
You'll lose it if it gets too far.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[103600900] ... ......  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[103601000] Confirmed. Unidentified machine down.<br />
[103601001] MDD... Encoded comms...<br />
[103601002] Was that mech behind what happened here?  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[103601100] ...621. Continue the investigation.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[103601200] It's got you in its sights!  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[103601300] ...... ...  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[103601400] ...Another one of those stealth mechs.<br />
[103601401] Don't let it outpace you, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[103601500] 621. I think there's more than one this time.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[103601600] Use your scanner—mark your targets
to undermine their tricks.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[103601700] ... ......  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[103601800] Unidentified machine down.<br />
[103601801] We should be clear for now.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[103601900] Keep going, and stay sharp.  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[103602000] 46492e204554  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[103602100] 53424c  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[103602200] It looks like that mech is
communicating with someone...<br />
[103602201] Whoever it is, chances are they're
behind the attack on the Arsenal.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[103602300] According to the blueprint, there's a massive
water reservoir deep inside the Arsenal.<br />
[103602301] If there's anything waiting for us,
that's where it'll be.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[103602400] ...... ...  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[103602500] Wait! 621, behind you!<br />
[103602501] Sneaky little bastard...
It was waiting to ambush you!  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[103602600] ... ......  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[103602700] ...All clear.<br />
[103602701] Keep going, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[103602800] ...... ...  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[103602900] ...Good eye.<br />
[103602901] See, I told you to expect the unexpected.  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[103603000] ... ......  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[103603100] Confirmed. Unidentified mech destroyed.
Keep going, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[103603200] Entering the reservoir.
Brace yourself, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[103603300] Is that...a Coral response?<br />
[103603301] 621, get down and take a closer look.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[103603400] No doubt about it.
This water...<br />
[103603401] ...It contains faint traces of Coral.
Must have been an underground vein...<br />
[103603402] BAWS was hiding a "well" all this time.  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[103603500] ...... ...  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[103603600] 621! Above you!  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[103603700] ...... ... ...... ...<br />
[103603701] ... ......  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[103603800] Three of them... No, four.  </p>
<h4>Section 38</h4>
<p>[103603900] Four of them... No, five.  </p>
<h4>Section 39</h4>
<p>[103604000] You're outnumbered.
Pick them off one by one, 621!  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[103604100] One of them's deploying pulse armor...<br />
[103604101] It won't be easy to break.
Prioritize the others.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[103604200] ... ......  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[103604300] One unidentified mech down.  </p>
<h4>Section 43</h4>
<p>[103604400] ... ......  </p>
<h4>Section 44</h4>
<p>[103604500] Another dealt with.<br />
[103604501] Stay focused, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 45</h4>
<p>[103604600] 53424c  </p>
<h4>Section 46</h4>
<p>[103604700] Three remaining.  </p>
<h4>Section 47</h4>
<p>[103604800] 53424c  </p>
<h4>Section 48</h4>
<p>[103604900] Looks like two left.  </p>
<h4>Section 49</h4>
<p>[103605000] ... ......  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[103605100] One remaining. Finish them off.  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[103605200] ... ......  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[103605300] ...Seems that's the last of them.  </p>
<h4>Section 53</h4>
<p>[103605400] This wasn't a simple check-in after all.
Head back and rest up, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 54</h4>
<p>[103605500] ... ...... ... ......  </p>
<h3>1037</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[103700100] I've sent you the marker data.<br />
[103700101] Let's head toward the elevator
going to the upper level.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[103700200] Who's this tourist?<br />
[103700201] You think you can just waltz straight in here?  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[103700220] Hope you're watchin', boss.<br />
[103700221] Leave it to "Invincible" Rummy to
show our guest a good time!  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[103700240] Arena registration found.
AC identified as MAD STOMP.<br />
[103700241] ...Ranked dead last.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[103700260] Me and MAD STOMP can't be beat!  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[103700280] Argh...! You're no ordinary tourist!  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[103700300] N...No! MAD STOOOMP!<br />
[103700301] Hostile AC destroyed.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[103700320] Whoo! I'm INVINCIBLE!<br />
[103700321] Done and dusted.
Hook me up, boss, you know I deserve it.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[103700500] Looks like you're having fun...tourist.<br />
[103700501] Y'know, RaD loves a good welcome party.<br />
[103700502] Come on in and let's get acquainted.<br />
[103700503] How courteous.<br />
[103700504] Let's take her up on the offer, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[103700900] I've gathered data on the woman
from that broadcast.<br />
[103700901] That was Carla... Leader of RaD,
a formidable Doser faction.<br />
[103700902] She joined them three years ago, bringing
with her a crew of junk wizards and hackers.<br />
[103700903] Within half a year, she seized total control
and greatly expanded their operations.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[103701300] We're going in.
Be prepared for an am—<br />
[103701301] Kept us waiting, tourist!<br />
[103701302] Told you we love a good party.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[103701700] Well! You're no slouch, are you?  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[103701800] I've got you now!  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[103701820] An ambush?!
No affiliation... It's an independent mercenary.<br />
[103701821] I don't owe you a damn thing.
You've made a big mistake coming here!<br />
[103701822] I think he was expecting someone else.
Let's deal with him and be on our way.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[103701830] Ngh... You're sharper than the others!<br />
[103701831] But I still don't owe you a damn thing.
You've made a big mistake coming here!<br />
[103701832] No affiliation—it's an independent mercenary.<br />
[103701833] I think he was expecting someone else.
Let's deal with him and be on our way.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[103701840] Don't worry, I put your money to good use.<br />
[103701841] Just take a look at what my new AC can do...<br />
[103701842] My credit score's only going to go up!  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[103701850] Ngh... Get it through your thick skull!<br />
[103701851] Why would I RETURN what I borrow?!  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[103701860] You gotta put that shit to work...
Every last credit...<br />
[103701861] Hostile AC destroyed.
Let's move on.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[103701880] You rotten money-grubber.<br />
[103701881] You feel the pulse of this AC?
That's your money, seething with joy.  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[103701890] Ha. Decided to cut your losses?<br />
[103701891] Don't come back.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[103701900] You again?<br />
[103701901] You just don't learn, do you?  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[103702100] Can't get good help these days, can you?<br />
[103702101] It would have been cheaper
to just hire you instead!  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[103702500] Picking up multiple MTs.
Tread carefully.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[103702520] Nearly forgot your fireworks.  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[103702560] Oh, you noticed the fireworks I left for you!<br />
[103702561] You're a smart cookie, aren't you.  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[103702580] Interesting...<br />
[103702581] Seems our tourist is a cut above the rest.  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[103702900] Alright, tourist, that's enough.
You've made your point.<br />
[103702901] I surrender.
It's just not worth the losses.<br />
[103702902] C'mon, I'll let you through. Hop along, now.  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[103703000] Let's see what she has up her sleeve.<br />
[103703001] Shall we, Raven?  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[103703300] You're not afraid of anything, are you?<br />
[103703301] I like that in a tourist.  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[103703400] Too bad that this is goodbye.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[103703700] So it was a trap.<br />
[103703701] The Dosers are certainly
living up to their reputation.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[103704100] It's some kind of autonomous demolition
mech—a rather well equipped one.<br />
[103704101] Those grinder arms can easily
destroy an AC... Be careful.  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[103704500] It's been hardened with the same steel
plating that makes up the Grid's floor.<br />
[103704501] There must be a weakness somewhere.
Let's find it.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[103704900] There. That furnace is connected to
the internal generator.<br />
[103704901] Try aiming for the intake,
or attack the exhaust from above.  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[103705300] Nice! I heard you were good.<br />
[103705301] But the Cleaner's going to have the last laugh.<br />
[103705302] Its behavioral pattern has changed...
Watch out.  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[103705700] Enemy systems offline.
Complete shutdown confirmed.  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[103706100] ...Enough, tourist.
It's been miserable knowing you, but...<br />
[103706101] I guess playing nice is the smart choice here.<br />
[103706102] You want to go up top, right?
Let me show you the way.<br />
[103706103] Guided tour from "Cinder" Carla herself.  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[103706500] Oh, finished already?<br />
[103706501] Not so sharp after all.
What a letdown.  </p>
<h3>1039</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[103900100] Let's get rolling, tourist.<br />
[103900101] Destroy all the hacking drones
those degenerate Coyotes left here.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[103900200] Let's be quick about this, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[103900300] Security breach has reached 10%.<br />
[103900301] Our firewall's going down fast...
Must be about five drones to pull that off.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[103900400] Coyote hacking drone identified.
Down below, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[103900420] Coyote hacking drone detected.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[103900440] Hacking drone identified.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[103900460] Hacking drone detected.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[103900500] Confirmed. Target destroyed.<br />
[103900501] Four to go.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[103900600] Straight out of the gates.
Keep it up, tourist.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[103900700] Took your sweet time...
Hurry it up, tourist!  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[103900800] The Coyotes are using RaD MTs—
they're hot stuff on the black market.<br />
[103900801] Still, I'm not sure I like seeing my
own babies used against me.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[103900900] Second target destroyed.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[103901000] I get why they want our tech, I just
wish they had a little more flair.<br />
[103901001] If it were me, I'd raid us from orbit and
just yank our servers off the ground.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[103901100] Three left...
You've gotta work faster.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[103901200] Confirmed. Target destroyed.<br />
[103901201] Two remaining.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[103901300] Guess I better get to work
on our countermeasures.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[103901400] It's looking dicey...
Get moving, tourist!  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[103901500] Fourth target destroyed.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[103901600] One left...
You'd have to try to mess it up now.  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[103901700] One left! There's no time, tourist!  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[103901800] Security breach has reached 50%.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[103901900] We can still make it, Raven.<br />
[103901901] If you can't spot the targets,
try using your scanner.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[103902000] They've got our crypto keys.
That's uh, not great.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[103902100] Faster, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[103902200] The firewall won't hold much longer!  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[103902300] What happened?!<br />
[103902301] It's all over.
They've taken everything.<br />
[103902302] Well. You're in trouble now, tourist.  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[103902400] That's five.
All hacking drones destroyed.  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[103902500] Wow. That was fast.  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[103902600] Good job, tourist.  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[103902700] Just in time...
They nearly had us.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[103902800] I've sent the Coyotes and their pals a little
countervirus—their servers are officially fried.<br />
[103902801] Maybe that'll teach 'em to behave.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[103902900] Wait, the radar...
Are there more of them?  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[103903000] They're outside.
Let's move to intercept.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[103903100] Raven, they've called in backup.
Shall we step outside and say hello?  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[103903200] I see the Coyotes got some help too...
Don't forget to smile, tourist.  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[103903300] Identifying enemy AC.<br />
[103903301] AC: HEAD BRINGER.
Pilot: G5 Iguazu.<br />
[103903302] You and he have a history...  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[103903400] I heard about you climbing the Wall.
Bet you think you're hot shit now...<br />
[103903401] Well, you're making a stink.<br />
[103903402] You're gonna die, freelancer!  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[103903500] Y'know, I really owe ya one...<br />
[103903501] You got lucky at the Dam, and I'm gonna prove it.<br />
[103903502] You're gonna die, freelancer!  </p>
<h4>Section 38</h4>
<p>[103903600] Ugh... That ringing in my ears again...<br />
[103903601] It'll be peace and quiet when you're gone!  </p>
<h4>Section 39</h4>
<p>[103903700] You just don't quit, do you!  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[103903800] Huh?!  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[103903900] New hostiles detected!<br />
[103903901] Stealth mechs—they're not Coyotes!  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[103904000] 57482e2045482e2043342d363231<br />
[103904001] ...... ... ...<br />
[103904002] 452e2043342d363231<br />
[103904003] What the hell?!<br />
[103904004] Tch... They're all over us...!
Help me out, or we're both dead!  </p>
<h4>Section 43</h4>
<p>[103904100] You psycho or something?!
We're both in trouble here!  </p>
<h4>Section 44</h4>
<p>[103904200] You lowdown piece of...<br />
[103904201] Don't you dare think you've won!  </p>

<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[104001300] You see that, 621?
That dome's your refinery plant.<br />
[104001301] I've updated your marker data.
Head for the target.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>

<p>[104003000] I've identified PCA SP...
Special Forces!<br />

621—eliminate them!  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[104003020] ...EKDROMOI—PCA SP machines.<br />
[104003021] They're highly mobile executioners for
priority targets, piloted by the PCA's elites.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[104003040] Focus on one at a time, 621.
Don't let them double-team you.  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[104003060] You're a real troublemaker, Raven...<br />
[104003061] I didn't expect this level of resistance, sir.<br />
[104003062] We won't fail this time. The System gave
its verdict—immediate termination.<br />

Have you had an encounter with the PCA before?  </p>

[104004101] They got their "walking advertisement" alright.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[104004500] We'll have earned plenty of extra pay at least.<br />
[104004501] I think we've done enough to inspire
other mercenaries to work for Arquebus.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[104004900] I don't have high hopes for extra pay...<br />
[104004901] I think we've done enough to inspire

<p>[104206400] I'm picking up something!  </p>
<h4>Section 54</h4>
<p>[104206500] I've sent you a marker.
There's something there...  </p>
<h4>Section 55</h4>
<p>[104206900] It's... It's underground!  </p>
<h4>Section 56</h4>
<p>[104207300] What?!  </p>
<h4>Section 57</h4>
<p>[104207700] What...
What is that thing?!  </p>
<h4>Section 58</h4>
<p>[104208100] 621, listen—your attacks won't have any effect.  </p>
<h4>Section 59</h4>
<p>[104208200] Raven! Evasive maneuvers!  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[104208400] Is that...another PCA weapon?!  </p>
<h4>Section 61</h4>
<p>[104208500] This Coral response...
There's no pilot.<br />
[104208501] It's an autonomous C-Weapon!  </p>
<h4>Section 62</h4>
<p>[104208600] I can't get a read on it! This is bad!  </p>
<h4>Section 63</h4>
<p>[104208700] Just focus on staying alive, 621!  </p>
<h3>1046</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[104600100] Commence mission.<br />
[104600101] I've estimated the target's position based on
the data we received. Sending results now.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[104600200] Watch out for the surveillance MTs. If they
get a read on you, this operation is over.<br />
[104600201] If you pick up a capture camera tracking you,
take cover or quickly destroy it.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[104600240] Raven.
Let's prepare ourselves by scanning the area.<br />
[104600241] Learning where the enemy is deployed
will make it easier to avoid detection.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[104600300] Camera looking this way!  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[104600400] A camera's tracking you!  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[104600500] Raven! Surveillance MT!  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[104600520] There's a lot of surveillance MTs...<br />
[104600521] Raven. Check to see where they're deployed.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[104600540] ...So far so good, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[104600560] ...We need to choose our route carefully.<br />
[104600561] Do your best to avoid combat.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[104600580] If only we weren't on a mission...<br />
[104600581] Rubicon's so beautiful at night.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[104600600] Swinburne, sir!
We've identified the intruding AC!<br />
[104600601] I saw. An independent mercenary...
Must be working for the Liberation Front.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[104600620] Capture complete.
Sending data to Swinburne.<br />
[104600621] ...They've caught us.
Mission failed.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[104600640] Sir! We've got a capture of the intruding AC!<br />
[104600641] Well done.
I'll handle it from here.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[104600700] No sign of the target, it seems.<br />
[104600701] Perhaps he's out on night watch.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[104600800] Raven—look over there!  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[104600900] I've detected an AC in combat mode.
That must be Swinburne, the target.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[104601000] All these lawless ruffians...
They never learn, do they?<br />
[104601001] This isn't how the Liberation Front
builds their ACs...  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[104601100] Target confirmed.
It's Swinburne, the Vespers' No. 7.<br />
[104601101] This is our opportunity for an ambush.
Let's go.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[104601200] I see... Balam. A tired old concern,
falling further and further behind.<br />
[104601201] I'll have you all sent for re-education...
Snail will be pleased to have you.  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[104601300] Hm? Back to your post, grunt.
I can handle myself, thank—  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[104601400] What?!<br />
[104601401] Wh-Who are you?!  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[104601500] Stop right there!
How dare you pretend to be one of my own...!  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[104601600] Agh!  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[104601700] Wh-What do you think you're playing at?!<br />
[104601701] W-Wait! You're not one of mine...
Another ambusher?!  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[104601800] Gah!  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[104601900] Wh-What the—?!<br />
[104601901] S-Stop that!
How dare you attack me with my back turned...!  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[104602000] It's a good thing he came out here.
You can just focus on fighting now.  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[104602100] I don't know who put you up to this...<br />
[104602101] But clearly you need to be disciplined!  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[104602200] You've got skills...
Shame you don't put them to good use.<br />
[104602201] But that can be changed! With a little
reprogramming, you'll make a fine soldier!  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[104602300] Your opportunity to start
anew has come, mercenary.<br />
[104602301] To the re-education center with you! Ta-ta!  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[104602400] No!<br />
[104602401] I am Swinburne! I can't lose!  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[104602500] W-Wait! Let's not do anything hasty!<br />
[104602501] You realize I lead the Vesper's 7th squad...
which means I hold the purse strings.<br />
[104602502] Every single transaction goes through me.<br />
[104602503] Let me go, and you'll still come out on top...
Understand?  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[104602600] Stubborn to the last...
You don't know what's good for you.<br />
[104602601] Fine, then! Discipline it is!  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[104602620] Agh!  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[104602640] I asked you a question!
Don't you have any manners?!<br />
[104602641] You need discipline!  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[104602700] W-Wait! No! Please!<br />
[104602701] EAAARGH!  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[104602800] Confirmed. Target destroyed.<br />
[104602801] ...<br />
[104602802] Let's go home, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[104602900] You're quick on the uptake, aren't you? Splendid.  </p>
<h4>Section 38</h4>
<p>[104603000] I'm sure Snail will see you're
properly honored for this...<br />
[104603001] You're not like those savages.
Keep up the good work.  </p>
<h4>Section 39</h4>
<p>[104603100] Y-You cur! Who taught you to—<br />
[104603101] EAAARGH!  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[104603200] Confirmed. Target destroyed.<br />
[104603201] ...<br />
[104603202] I have a question.<br />
[104603203] The way you dealt with him—
did Walter teach you that?  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[104603300] ...Swinburne has left the combat zone.<br />
[104603301] Raven. I'll respect your decision,
but I should tell you that...<br />
[104603302] Wait! I'm picking up something.
Incoming!  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[104603400] We're under attack!<br />
[104603401] Is that a Liberation Front AC?!
Prepare to intercept!  </p>
<h4>Section 43</h4>
<p>[104603500] The scoundrel's profits—
coins slipping through cold fingers.<br />
[104603501] Feed Rubicon's soil!  </p>
<h4>Section 44</h4>
<p>[104603600] I've gathered data on the enemy AC.<br />
[104603601] That's Rokumonsen, an elite assassin
associated with the Rubicon Liberation Front.<br />
[104603602] Don't let him confuse you with his theatrics—
he's not playing around.  </p>
<h4>Section 45</h4>
<p>[104603700] Though false be your oath,
Your seditious blade strikes true.<br />
[104603701] Savage is the cur!  </p>
<h4>Section 46</h4>
<p>[104603740] I shall pay my dues.<br />
[104603741] Watch me, good comrade Ziyi,
Your reward has come!  </p>
<h4>Section 47</h4>
<p>[104603800] Heed me, oathbreaker...
Treachery benefits none.<br />
[104603801] Coral take you, cur!  </p>
<h4>Section 48</h4>
<p>[104603900] Confirmed. Enemy AC destroyed.<br />
[104603901] ...<br />
[104603902] That was certainly an adventure.  </p>
<h4>Section 49</h4>
<p>[104603940] Another star fades.<br />
[104603941] Witness my steel, errant cur...
Man and mount as one!  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[104604000] He's got the upper hand...<br />
[104604001] Don't let him play mind games, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[104604020] Clash, steel upon steel!<br />
[104604021] But soon you will bend, and then—
Then I shall have you!  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[104604040] Blossoms soon to fade...<br />
[104604041] Though our dance may be fleeting,
I shall make my mark!  </p>
<h4>Section 53</h4>
<p>[104604100] A vow forsaken—
Death, the only salvation.<br />
[104604101] Rest with the Coral!  </p>
<h3>1047</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[104700100] Raven. The ECM won't interfere with our Contact.<br />
[104700101] But it is affecting your lock-on range.
Keep an eye on your surroundings.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[104700500] This must be a beacon left by the survey drone.<br />
[104700501] I'll use markers to track them—
you can use them if you lose your way.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[104700600] Unknown intruder detected.
Normalization Process E.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[104700900] Those seem to be city defense automatons.<br />
[104700901] They must have stood watch even after
they were abandoned by their masters...  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[104701300] I've located an ECM fog control device.
See if you can access it.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[104701700] Confirmed. The control device is offline.<br />
[104701701] Let's keep looking, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[104701710] Intrusion detected.
Normalization Process C.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[104701720] I doubt even the corporations
know about this city yet...<br />
[104701721] So how did Walter's "friend" find out?
I'm certainly feeling curious.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[104701800] Intrusion attempt persisting.
Normalization Process A.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[104701900] I can't find any data on these...<br />
[104701901] I'm sorry, Raven.
You'll have to rely on your experience.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[104702100] Second fog control device located.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[104702500] Confirmed. Control device is silent.
Let's find the next one.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[104702600] Why would they build this city on the ocean?<br />
[104702601] The name "Xylem" refers to plant tissue
that carries water and dissolved nutrients...<br />
[104702602] Perhaps the city served as a maritime relay
for transporting Rubicon's resources.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[104702900] Is that the survey drone Walter mentioned?<br />
[104702901] We might be able to extract its data.
Let's take a look.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[104703300] Wait! Hostile readings!  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[104703400] Normalization Process B2: Deploying Antigens.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[104703500] ...Fight back, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[104703700] ...Now we know what happened to the drone.<br />
[104703701] Fortunately, the data we found helped to
identify where the last ECM device is.<br />
[104703702] I've set a marker for it.
Let's check it out.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[104703900] You know...<br />
[104703901] It's been a long time since we've been
on a mission together without Walter.<br />
[104703902] ...The control device isn't going anywhere.<br />
[104703903] Take your time, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[104704000] One target left...<br />
[104704001] Once the ECM fog has cleared, we'll be able
to see what this city really looks like.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[104704100] Raven, that's the last of the control devices.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[104704500] We'll have Walter back after this...  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[104704540] Intruder neutralized.
Normalization complete.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[104704600] 62...do you...ead me?<br />
[104704601] Do you read me? You've got PCA incoming.  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[104704900] Pull out before they make this complicated.  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[104705300] ...I'm afraid it's too late for that.  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[104705700] ...Guess we're complicating things.<br />
[104705701] So much for subtlety.
You'll have to fight your way out now.<br />
[104705702] Take them down, 621—I'll clean up the mess.  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[104705900] PCA heavy combat helicopters.
They're equipped for anti-AC operations.<br />
[104705901] Be ready for missiles and explosive fire!  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[104706000] ...Raven. I've identified a
vulnerability in Xylem's system.<br />
[104706001] Try accessing it if you need support.  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[104706040] ...Raven. I've identified some
Xylem defenses we can co-opt.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[104706100] This is it. I'll override some
of the city's defense grid.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[104706140] Alright. I'll take a few
liberties with the system.  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[104706200] Normalization Process E: Activating defenses.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[104706300] Normalization Process C: Activating defenses.<br />
[104706301] Normalization Process A: Activating defenses.<br />
[104706302] Normalization Process B2: Activating defenses.  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[104706340] There. Xylem's defenses now
recognize you as an ally.<br />
[104706341] That should help keep the PCA busy!  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[104706400] You're wearing it down—finish it, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[104706500] Raven—the defenses can be activated again.  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[104706600] Press the advantage, 621.<br />
[104706601] You've come a long way since your
crash landing on Rubicon—show them.  </p>
<h4>Section 38</h4>
<p>[104706700] Raven—the city defenses are
ready to provide backup!  </p>
<h4>Section 39</h4>
<p>[104706800] ...Looks like you did it—
and the ECM fog's cleared too.<br />
[104706801] Now my friend can get back to surveying.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[104706840] ...A survey the PCA wants to block.<br />
[104706841] What is this city...?<br />
[104706842] And who is Walter's friend...?  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[104706900] 62...do you...rea...  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[104707000] ...ECM subter...ge systems offline.
Switching to encrypted c...rcuit.<br />
[104707001] Registration number: Rb23. Callsign: Raven.
Apologies for the intrusion.  </p>
<h4>Section 43</h4>
<p>[104707100] This is a special mercenary support
message from ALLMIND.  </p>
<h4>Section 44</h4>
<p>[104707200] You have been followed.
Contact is imminent—  </p>
<h4>Section 45</h4>
<p>[104707300] &lt;?lt?&gt;gasp&lt;?gt?&gt; Hostile incoming, AC!  </p>
<h4>Section 46</h4>
<p>[104707400] Forged in ash, we stand as one...<br />
[104707401] This place will be your grave, menace to Rubicon.  </p>
<h4>Section 47</h4>
<p>[104707440] Callsign: Raven.
Augmented human C4-621.<br />
[104707441] Please destroy the hostile AC.  </p>
<h4>Section 48</h4>
<p>[104707500] A direct request from ALLMIND...
through the support system...?!<br />
[104707501] ...<br />
[104707502] Raven—here's the data on that AC.<br />
[104707503] Arena rank A, identified as ASTGHIK.
Piloted by...<br />
[104707504] the leader of the Rubicon Liberation Front,
Father Thumb Dolmayan!  </p>
<h4>Section 49</h4>
<p>[104707540] Raven. You're fighting a veteran
who survived the Fires of Ibis.<br />
[104707541] Stay focused.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[104707600] I know you, menace.<br />
[104707601] You can see them too...
The voices.<br />
[104707602] Just as I once did.  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[104707700] ...The records state that Dolmayan
was a Doser in his younger days.<br />
[104707701] This is just speculation, but...<br />
[104707702] perhaps he experienced mind-altering
effects not unlike the Contact we share.  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[104707800] How much of our hymn have you heard, menace?<br />
[104707801] "Coral, abide with Rubicon.<br />
[104707802] Coral, endure within us all,<br />
[104707803] For none of us shall cast the die."<br />
[104707804] ...The Coral must not be set free.<br />
[104707805] Only tragedy awaits beyond the threshold.  </p>
<h4>Section 53</h4>
<p>[104707900] Seria...<br />
[104707901] Forgive me... Forgive this old craven...  </p>
<h4>Section 54</h4>
<p>[104708000] ...Target destroyed. Good.  </p>
<h4>Section 55</h4>
<p>[104708100] The Rubiconians' "symbiosis" is no more
than suppression and exploitation of Coral.<br />
[104708101] We hope this encounter was informative.  </p>
<h4>Section 56</h4>
<p>[104708200] Now restoring the link to your Handler.<br />
[104708201] We shall speak again.  </p>
<h4>Section 57</h4>
<p>[104708300] It's better this way... It's better this way...<br />
[104708301] You must understand... Seria...  </p>
<h3>1048</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[104800100] Get into position, tourist! It's time!<br />
[104800101] I need you to protect that tower
until we've managed to take control.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[104800200] Normalization Process K.
Deploying shield.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[104800300] Chief, I've cracked some of the defense systems.<br />
[104800301] Good job, Chatty.
That'll buy us some time.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[104800400] ...Raven.
Standby at the marker.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[104800900] Looks like you're in position.
Chatty! How much longer till we have control?<br />
[104800901] Give me five minutes.
And the corps...  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[104801000] Give me seven minutes.
And the corps...  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[104801100] Give me six minutes.
And the corps...  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[104801200] Give me four minutes.
And the corps...  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[104801300] Give me three minutes.
And the corps...  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[104801500] ...I'm picking up an Arquebus MT squad.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[104801600] Well, guess who showed up early.<br />
[104801601] Looks like you're up already, tourist.<br />
[104801602] Give them the old RaD welcome.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[104801700] ...We have to see this through.<br />
[104801701] Raven... I'll support you!  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[104801800] Don't let them near the tower, tourist!  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[104801900] Four minutes left till
the system is ours, tourist.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[104801920] Five minutes left till
the system is ours, tourist.  </p>

<p>[104802060] Five more minutes.
Hang in there, tourist.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[104802100] I've got high-level access now.
Two more minutes and it's ours.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[104802140] I've got high-level access now.
Three more minutes and it's ours.  </p>

<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[104802240] ...Just one more minute to go, tourist.  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[104802300] Give me 30 seconds and
we'll have full admin access.  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[104802340] Just a little more, tourist!  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[104802400] Normalization Process B1: Plasma cannons ready.  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[104802440] We've got access to support weaponry.
Use them if you need the help.  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[104802500] Firing plasma cannons.
Commencing energy recharge.  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[104802900] Plasma cannon recharge complete.
Ready to fire again.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[104803300] Raven, the control tower's under attack!  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[104803700] Tower shield losing integrity!  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[104804100] The shield's at its limit!  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[104804200] ...Wait! We've got something else...<br />
[104804201] No vital signs—they’re suicide drones!<br />
[104804202] They're playing for keeps...
Make sure you don't miss, tourist.  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[104804500] The shield's offline!<br />
[104804501] Crap... We're in trouble now!  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[104804900] The tower can't take anymore!  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[104805300] The tower... It's been destroyed!<br />
[104805301] Access denied...
We're screwed now!  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[104805400] ...Tourist?!<br />
[104805401] Chatty! Get your AC!
I'll hack the system!  </p>
<h4>Section 38</h4>
<p>[104806100] Airborne squad approaching!<br />
[104806101] Death from above, tourist!  </p>
<h4>Section 39</h4>
<p>[104806200] Transport chopper bringing reinforcements!  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[104806300] Another chopper...
Here's your chance to take them all out at once!  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[104806500] Now we've got snipers!<br />
[104806501] Hey, tourist—go clear them out!  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[104806600] They've got you in their sights!
Eyes up top, tourist!  </p>
<h4>Section 43</h4>
<p>[104806700] Raven, sniper squad!  </p>
<h4>Section 44</h4>
<p>[104806900] Reinforcements! There's a lot of them...<br />
[104806901] Looks like they're falling over each
other to get your autograph, tourist.  </p>
<h4>Section 45</h4>
<p>[104807000] Enemy reinforcements detected!
Be careful, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 46</h4>
<p>[104807100] Another wave, incoming!<br />
[104807101] I thought they'd be done by now.
Send them home to Momma!  </p>
<h4>Section 47</h4>
<p>[104807200] I'm picking up reinforcements!  </p>
<h4>Section 48</h4>
<p>[104807300] Enemy reinforcements!  </p>

<h4>Section 56</h4>
<p>[104808100] In front of the tower!  </p>
<h4>Section 57</h4>
<p>[104808200] Left of the tower, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 58</h4>
<p>[104808300] Right of the tower, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 59</h4>
<p>[104808400] Arquebus's reinforcements can't keep up...<br />
[104808401] Seems they didn't expect an overachiever.  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[104808500] You've been working like a dog...<br />
[104808501] Must be Walter's influence.
Guy's a real slave driver.  </p>
<h4>Section 61</h4>
<p>[104809000] Raven, heavily armed LC!  </p>
<h4>Section 62</h4>
<p>[104809100] The plasma cannons have started recharging.

<h3>1049</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[104900100] V.IV... Rusty was the first to offer his help.<br />
[104900101] Work together to penetrate the Xylem's
drive block...and destroy the targets.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[104900200] Never thought the plan would go so wrong...<br />
[104900201] But it's good teaming up with you again.
Couldn't have hoped for a better silver lining.<br />
[104900202] I'll buy you a drink when this is over.
Maybe we can share some war stories.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[104900300] Those laser cannons are keeping us out.<br />
[104900301] Our target's inside. Let's hurry this up.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[104900400] Even more of RaD's MTs...<br />
[104900401] They're on auto-pilot...
They must be under the lockout program's control.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[104900500] Let's clean up, buddy.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[104900600] Target confirmed.
That's one of the skyrmion generators.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[104900700] One generator destroyed.<br />
[104900701] Three remaining.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[104900800] Looks like the Liberation Front
has broken into Institute City.<br />
[104900801] You should hear this—patching you in.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[104900900] Now, comrades! Rout the corporations!<br />
[104900901] Stop the Vascular Plant and bring the Coral home!<br />
[104900902] We'll show Raven—
the Rubiconians will wallow in the ashes no more!  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[104901000] Hear that, buddy?<br />
[104901001] Slogans scrawled in ash were
never going to change Rubicon...<br />
[104901002] The cinders are alive with flame once more.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[104901100] Two generators destroyed.<br />
[104901101] Two remaining.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[104901200] Surround the Plant!
Keep pushing them back!<br />
[104901201] Wait, I'm picking up a new signature...
Is that another Vesper?!  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[104901300] It's time.
Deploying the Schneider AC.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[104901400] ATTACK! Follow me!  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[104901500] Follow me, comrades! Attack!  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[104901600] What?! That's one of our ACs!  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[104901700] What...? That's one of our ACs.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[104901800] Of course... Rusty!  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[104901900] Sounds like quite the party down there.
Love to see all my hard work paying off.  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[104902000] That's the machine from Grid 086...  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[104902100] Looks like we've got our work cut out for us.
It'll be just like when we climbed the Wall...  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[104902200] I see... The intake's vulnerable.<br />
[104902201] I'll get its attention—you handle the shooting.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[104902300] ...Stay focused, Raven.
You've beaten this mech before.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[104902400] We're... We're losing?!
But we're... We're the Vespers!  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[104902500] This is bad...
The Liberation Front's never hit us this hard.  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[104902600] Secure the base of the Plant!<br />
[104902601] Yessir!  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[104902700] ...Bad news, Snail.
We don't have the forces left to hold the ground.<br />
[104902701] This is now an aerial operation.<br />
[104902702] Ready the interceptor fleet...
and your new machine.<br />
[104902703] ...Nothing to be concerned about.
The top was always my priority.  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[104902800] Enemy defenses compromised! Just a little more!<br />
[104902801] We've got it now.
Finish it off, buddy.  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[104902900] Confirmed. SMART CLEANER destroyed.<br />
[104902901] Wait, I'm detecting hostiles ahead of
the Xylem... Enemy fleet approaching!  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[104903000] Guess Arquebus decided to escalate...
They must really want us dead.<br />
[104903001] Let me handle the fleet.
You've got a mission to finish.<br />
[104903002] ...I'm counting on you, buddy.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[104903100] ...Let's keep up the pace, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[104903120] Wait, I'm detecting hostiles ahead of
the Xylem... Enemy fleet approaching!  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[104903140] Guess Arquebus decided to escalate...
They must really want us dead.<br />
[104903141] Let me handle the fleet.
You've got a mission to finish.<br />
[104903142] ...I'm counting you, buddy.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[104903160] Confirmed. SMART CLEANER destroyed.<br />
[104903161] ...Let's keep up the pace, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[104903200] We're entering the drive block's core.
Watch out for ambushes.  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[104903300] There's two skyrmion generators left.<br />
[104903301] Once we've shut those down,
we need to deal with the ramjet engine.<br />
[104903302] Destroy the generators and head outside.  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[104903400] Three generators destroyed.<br />
[104903401] One more to go!  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[104903500] Sustaining major damage!
We're dropping like flies out here!<br />
[104903501] Target is one AC! Identification...<br />
[104903502] ...V.IV... Rusty?!
He's supposed to be dead!<br />
[104903503] Full barrage! Don't let him get any closer!<br />
[104903504] You're out of luck.
There's only one person who can keep up with me.  </p>
<h4>Section 38</h4>
<p>[104903600] All skyrmion generators destroyed!<br />
[104903601] Get clear, Raven.
The drive block's going to explode!  </p>
<h4>Section 39</h4>
<p>[104903700] Bad news, buddy.
Something's heading straight for your position.<br />
[104903701] I've never seen something move that fast...
They must have finished work on BALTEUS!  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[104903800] Raven, we need to get outside fast!  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[104903900] ...Raven, the independent mercenary.
You're not the mutt I thought you were.  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[104904000] &lt;?lt?&gt;gasp&lt;?gt?&gt; That machine!  </p>
<h4>Section 43</h4>
<p>[104904100] You're below that—you are vermin!  </p>
<h4>Section 44</h4>
<p>[104904200] Analyzing enemy data.
AAP07A: ARQUEBUS BALTEUS.<br />
[104904201] Pilot identified as V.II Snail!  </p>
<h4>Section 45</h4>
<p>[104904300] ...The Xylem is doomed. Good.<br />
[104904301] It would be most inconvenient to see
our hard-won Coral go up in smoke.<br />
[104904302] Rabble-rousing the locals...
another inconvenience, but I'll overlook that.  </p>
<h4>Section 46</h4>
<p>[104904400] No, your crime is that you tried to kill me.
Kill Arquebus.  </p>
<h4>Section 47</h4>
<p>[104904500] You are vermin, and I will be rid of you!  </p>
<h4>Section 48</h4>
<p>[104904600] No, your crime is that you ignored me...
Ignored Arquebus.  </p>
<h4>Section 49</h4>
<p>[104904700] You are vermin, and I will be rid of you!  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[104904800] ...You're up against a former PCA machine
that has been modernized by Arquebus.<br />
[104904801] Energy output's off the charts...
Be careful, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[104904900] The second fleet has been wiped out!
We can't get a lock on him!<br />
[104904901] We're wearing the enemy AC down!
Maintain fire!<br />
[104904902] ...How's it looking, buddy?<br />
[104904903] I'd say I'm about...halfway done.<br />
[104904904] Snail might be V.II, but he's second to none.
Stay focused!  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[104905000] Energy output is ramping up again!  </p>
<h4>Section 53</h4>
<p>[104905100] Out of my sight, vermin!  </p>
<h4>Section 54</h4>
<p>[104905200] That traitor, V.IV...
Those dolts at Command...<br />
[104905201] And worst of all—you, the pest of Rubicon
who stirred the cinders...<br />
[104905202] You sicken me! All of you!<br />
[104905203] I'll crush you underfoot! I AM ARQUEBUS!  </p>
<h4>Section 55</h4>
<p>[104905300] The enemy's taken critical damage!  </p>
<h4>Section 56</h4>
<p>[104905400] We're... We're losing the flagship!<br />
[104905401] Deploy fighters! We need cover!<br />
[104905402] Whew. Knew there'd be more...
I'm beat, buddy.<br />
[104905403] ...Well. You're gonna finish this, right?<br />
[104905404] Guess I'm not done yet, then!  </p>
<h4>Section 57</h4>
<p>[104905500] No... I...am... ARQUEBUS!<br />
[104905501] One...last...plan...
EAAARGH!  </p>
<h4>Section 58</h4>
<p>[104905600] Enemy machine has gone silent.<br />
[104905601] Confirmed. V.II Snail...down.  </p>
<h4>Section 59</h4>
<p>[104905700] Sounds like it's over.<br />
[104905701] I...just about mana—  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[104905800] Rusty's signal just...disappeared!  </p>
<h4>Section 61</h4>
<p>[104905900] ...Raven. It seems we've got trouble ahead.<br />
[104905901] We need to take down the Xylem fast.  </p>
<h4>Section 62</h4>
<p>[104906000] ...Finally dead, are you?<br />
[104906001] Now I'll have to re-educate those apes...
More housekeeping.  </p>
<h3>1053</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[105300100] Alright, let's roll.<br />
[105300101] We've still got time until V.I deploys.
Deal with the corps' heavy hitters first.<br />
[105300102] We need you to have a chance at winning this.
No pressure, tourist!  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[105300400] Chatty, what's your situation?<br />
[105300401] Just about holding up.<br />
[105300402] Our own ace is on the way.
Hang in there!  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[105300900] Start with him. He's been roughing up my guys.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[105301000] V.II, situation report sir.
We've engaged the independent mercenary.<br />
[105301001] Oh... So that's where the mutt has been.<br />
[105301002] I've got fires to put out on the ground.
By all means, take charge of the trivialities.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[105301040] Get a load of the big mouth on him!<br />
[105301041] Hey, tourist, give him something to cry about.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[105301100] V.II! We're being pushed back!
Requesting backup!  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[105301200] My machine is breaking up!  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[105301300] Target destroyed.
Keep it up, tourist!  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[105301700] We're taking a pounding, chief. Looks like they
boosted some of the PCA's best hardware.<br />
[105301701] ...Hear that, tourist?<br />
[105301702] Let Chatty handle the starboard wing for now.
You need to deal with the target!  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[105302100] How's the dome looking, Chatty?<br />
[105302101] We won't hold it for long.
They're packing serious heat.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[105302200] Hey, tourist.<br />
[105302201] Don't worry about us.<br />
[105302202] We've seen what you can do...<br />
[105302203] We can hold them—because we believe in you.<br />
[105302204] ...Chatty?
You're talkative all of a sudden.<br />
[105302205] Finally living up to your nickname, aren't you?  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[105302300] Visuals on the independent mercenary, sir!<br />
[105302301] ...Understood.
Eliminating!  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[105302500] ...Now we've got an HC.<br />
[105302501] Guess Arquebus likes to recycle too.
At least that PCA tech isn't going to waste.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[105302600] This merc means business!<br />
[105302601] V.II, sir! Is V.I ready to—  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[105302640] I told you not to bother me, grunt.
Handle it.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[105302700] We're losing the advantage!  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[105302740] That's good hardware, and the pilot isn't bad...
Just picked the wrong place to be.<br />
[105302741] Keep on hammering him, tourist!  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[105302800] S-Some mercenary...  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[105302900] ...Looks like we've secured the area.
Resupply while you can.  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[105302910] Enemy reinforcements, chief.
Too many to handle.<br />
[105302911] Where do they even find all these people?!<br />
[105302912] Go give Chatty a helping hand, tourist.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[105303300] Chief—enemy detected, coming in hot.
ID code reads...<br />
[105303301] V.I...!
Freud's making his move!<br />
[105303302] Hurry it up, tourist!  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[105303700] Kept me waiting, tourist.<br />
[105303701] You made it...
Chatty, good job holding out!<br />
[105303702] Did what I could. Now we can fight back.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[105303800] I'm reading multiple LCs...
And a pulse protection drone.<br />
[105303801] Take 'em out, tourist.
Sorry to add more to your plate.<br />
[105303802] I'll move up front and draw their fire.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[105303900] Looks like you got 'em all.<br />
[105303901] ...Chief.
V.I is close.<br />
[105303902] Oh yeah? No rest for the wicked!  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[105304100] ...Seems they weren't so trivial after all.<br />
[105304101] Never mind.
That's what we have V.I for.  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[105304200] Here he is...
That's the Vespers' ace!  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[105304500] Let's get this trash out of the way.  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[105304900] ...Chief...
...Tou...rist...<br />
[105304901] Chatty?!<br />
[105304902] Chatty...
He's—!<br />
[105304903] AI-controlled AC.
Always the same.<br />
[105304904] ...<br />
[105304905] Do it, tourist.  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[105305300] I haven't seen moves like that before.<br />
[105305301] Interesting.  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[105305400] This is no time for fun and games, Freud.<br />
[105305401] Our objective is to seize the Xylem.
You can ignore the mutt.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[105305700] Yes, Snail.
You're right.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[105305800] Now then.<br />
[105305801] Let's continue.  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[105305900] I'm glad I chose your company over Snail's.<br />
[105305901] You fight like a hound on the hunt.<br />
[105305902] At this altitude...I'd expected a scavenger bird.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[105305940] ...Sorry to leave you hanging, tourist.<br />
[105305941] Watch those laser drones. It takes serious
skill to use them the way he does...  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[105306000] What a glorious view...<br />
[105306001] What I wouldn't give to fight like this forever.<br />
[105306002] You've nearly got him, tourist!<br />
[105306003] Show him that we're not doing this for fun.  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[105306100] Not now...
LOCKSMITH...!<br />
[105306101] More...! I want...more...  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[105306500] ...<br />
[105306501] Confirmed. V.I... Freud, down.  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[105306900] I was right to bet on you, tourist.<br />
[105306901] Me, Walter... Chatty...
We were all counting on you.  </p>
<h4>Section 38</h4>
<p>[105307000] ...No. More.<br />
[105307001] Get up.
The fun's only just begun.  </p>
<h3>1061</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[106100100] Commence mission.<br />
[106100101] Access the elevator and take it down.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[106100200] What are you doing, 621?
Access the elevator and take it down.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[106100500] Intruder detected. Threat level unknown.<br />
[106100501] Defense Phase 1.0.
Commencing termination.<br />
[106100502] The defense system has activated.
It's got eyes on you—fight back.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[106100900] ...The elevator's locked out.<br />
[106100901] We have no choice but to jump.
Let's go, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[106101300] Watch out—below you!<br />
[106101301] That's NEPENTHES...
and it's clearly a force to be reckoned with.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[106101700] Wait—the partition's moving!<br />
[106101701] I'm picking up enemy signals nearby!  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[106101800] Containing intruder.
Commencing termination.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[106101900] Assigning intruder threat level.<br />
[106101901] Threat level 4... 6...<br />
[106101902] Level 6: Resistant to termination.
Preparing for Defense Phase 1.5.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[106102100] ...You're clear. I'll find a way to get that
partition open. Stand by for now, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[106102120] ...Over there. I've sent you a marker.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[106102200] NEPENTHES...
It's named after an extinct genus of plants.<br />
[106102201] They were rather unusual...
You should look into them sometime, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[106102203] ...Raven, we should keep moving.<br />
[106102204] I've marked the point you should access.
That should open the way for us.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[106102500] Did you find an access point?
Good job sniffing that out...  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[106102600] It's opening.
Let's keep moving.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[106102700] Unauthorized access detected.
Transitioning to Phase 1.5.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[106102900] It's changed its combat routine, Raven.
Watch out for those plasma missiles.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[106103000] You've got it in your sights now, 621.
...Just need to get a little closer.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[106103100] It's tracking you, 621!  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[106103200] Evasive action!  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[106103300] ...You're up close now, 621.
Destroy the target.<br />
[106103301] Raven—it'll be easier to immobilize
if you aim for the neck joint.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[106103400] NEPENTHES sustaining damage.<br />
[106103401] Overriding Depth 1 defense plan.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[106103700] The NEPENTHES artillery platform is silent.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[106104100] Confirmed—target destroyed.
Mission accomplished.<br />
[106104101] Let's rest while we can, Raven.
We've got a long road ahead of us.  </p>
<h3>1062</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[106200100] Comms are going to be spotty in the lower depths.
No hand-holding.<br />
[106200101] Use that fried brain of yours instead.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[106200500] Let's go, Raven.<br />
[106200501] This is where the survey begins in earnest.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[106200900] According to the structural drawings,
the route continues past this partition. <br />
[106200901] Looks like the power's out.
Let's find a way to bring it back online.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[106201300] Been waiting for you, Raven!<br />
[106201301] You're gonna die, traitor!<br />
[106201302] An ambush!<br />
[106201303] ...Sounds like you found Balam's MTs.<br />
[106201304] Eliminate them, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[106201400] Damn you, Arquebus...  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[106201700] Control panel identified.
This should get the power back online.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[106202100] The elevator's back online, too.
Let's take it back up to the upper level.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[106202500] The partition should open now.
See if you can get access.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[106202520] The heat exchanger section's up ahead.<br />
[106202521] This is around where the comms log
for Balam's advance squad cuts off.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[106202600] Been waiting for you...freelancer!<br />
[106202601] That AC... It's HEAD BRINGER.<br />
[106202602] G5 Iguazu.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[106202620] You're my ticket back above ground...<br />
[106202621] Let me tell you, I am
sick and tired of this pit...<br />
[106202622] It'll all be over once your sorry ass is dead!  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[106202630] Ngh...! My ears... Not now...!<br />
[106202631] That quack messed me up...!  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[106202640] Learned some new tricks, huh?!<br />
[106202641] I know you're laughing at me...
What makes YOU so special, freelancer?!  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[106202660] This isn't... This isn't over...!<br />
[106202661] Next time, I swear I'll...<br />
[106202662] ...Confirmed. G5 Iguazu down.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[106202680] Heh! Who's laughing now?!<br />
[106202681] You're not so special, freelancer...  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[106202700] His fixation on you must have only added
to the stress and trauma he felt...<br />
[106202701] Being trapped down here...
It's dangerous.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[106202720] We're in the second Depth...
How far do you think we are from the surface?<br />
[106202721] Rubicon still has its share of secrets...
I learned that from being with you.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[106202740] ...There's something I've realized,
being deep underground.<br />
[106202741] Coral has an instinct to gather together...
and it seems I am no exception.<br />
[106202742] I feel...a growing urge to move forward.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[106202800] It seems...we're alone.  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[106202810] &lt;?lt?&gt;gasp&lt;?gt?&gt; Raven, behind you!  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[106202815] &lt;?lt?&gt;gasp&lt;?gt?&gt; Raven, ambush!  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[106202820] You must be Raven...
Yes, you do seem rather extraordinary.<br />
[106202821] Well.
Nothing personal—this is just business.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[106202830] I'll get some data on the enemy.<br />
[106202831] ...Independent mercenary, Coldcall.
AC, DEADSLED.<br />
[106202832] It seems he's a black-market contract killer.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[106202840] I see why poor Iguazu couldn't beat you.<br />
[106202841] Why he abandoned his Redgun pride
and succumbed to his frustrations...<br />
[106202842] Ah, what a pity.<br />
[106202843] You shouldn't have been so hard on the poor lad.  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[106202850] Ah, is that your game...?<br />
[106202851] I'd hoped to carry your body back in one piece
and deposit it at the lad's feet...<br />
[106202852] But it seems things won't be so easy.  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[106202860] Of course...
Gen Four augmentation, I presume?<br />
[106202861] Mixed with something else, I see...<br />
[106202862] How poor Iguazu must have feared it...
The unknown within you.  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[106202870] Dead, are we?<br />
[106202871] I hope the lad got what he wanted.  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[106202880] ...Ah, it comes...<br />
[106202881] The inevitable...  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[106202890] ...AC, DEADSLED destroyed.
Coldcall won't be a danger to you anymore.  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[106202900] Iguazu... 
He even tried sending an assassin after you...<br />
[106202901] Iguazu has more than a grudge against you—
he's completely obsessed.<br />
[106202902] We should be careful.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[106203000] Defense program, Phase 2.0.<br />
[106203001] Intruder identified. Threat level: 7.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[106203100] What was that...?  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[106203200] Raven, watch out!  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[106203300] ...That weapon must be guarding this Depth.<br />
[106203301] I'll see what data I can find.  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[106203400] Defense program, Phase 2.5.<br />
[106203401] Intruder proximity to critical sector confirmed.  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[106203500] Locking down partition systems.  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[106203700] ...Looks like we're not far from the terminus.<br />
[106203701] Let's find the control room. We'll hack
the systems and get the partitions open.  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[106203800] The elevator's been shut down.
The control room must be below.  </p>
<h4>Section 38</h4>
<p>[106203820] This elevator's locked out too.  </p>
<h4>Section 39</h4>
<p>[106204100] ...Raven, let's look for a ventilation duct.<br />
[106204101] We're underground—there must be one somewhere.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[106204500] Ventilation duct identified.
Looks like it's connected to the control room.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[106204600] We're in the control room.
Now, let's find an access point.  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[106204610] Looks like the partitions on
the upper level have closed.<br />
[106204611] Let's find the access point
and lift the lockdown.  </p>
<h4>Section 43</h4>
<p>[106204620] There, that's the control panel.  </p>
<h4>Section 44</h4>
<p>[106204640] I've forced the partitions and
the elevators back online.<br />
[106204641] The defense system is onto us,
but we should be able to proceed.  </p>
<h4>Section 45</h4>
<p>[106204900] Seems like smooth sailing, 621.<br />
[106204901] As if you hardly need help from me.
When'd you get so good at exploring?  </p>
<h4>Section 46</h4>
<p>[106205700] I expect that defense weapon
will be waiting for us.<br />
[106205701] Be careful, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 47</h4>
<p>[106206100] Enemy analysis complete.<br />
[106206101] That's the ENFORCER, an AI-controlled
prototype developed by the PCA.<br />
[106206102] It was designed to defend key Watchpoint sectors,
and eliminate any intruders...<br />
[106206103] Whatever they're hiding down here,
they wanted it to stay hidden.  </p>
<h4>Section 48</h4>
<p>[106206500] Phase 3.5, Pattern E.
Releasing output limiters.<br />
[106206501] Reconfiguring energy draw and
maximum values for all actuators.<br />
[106206502] Terminating intruder.  </p>
<h4>Section 49</h4>
<p>[106206600] Threat level 7... 8...<br />
[106206601] Verdict: Threat...to priority closure...  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[106206700] Evasive maneuvers, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[106206800] Raven, you're the only one
who can complete this survey.<br />
[106206801] Walter believes in you...and so do I.  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[106206900] Confirmed. Enemy unit is silent.  </p>
<h4>Section 53</h4>
<p>[106207300] ...Walter should have some
data on the next sector.<br />
[106207301] Let's take a break for now, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 54</h4>
<p>[106207700] Termination complete.<br />
[106207701] Resetting defense phase.  </p>
<h3>1063</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[106300100] Commence mission.
Make your way down to the next Depth.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[106300200] We're not here to smell the roses, 621.
Head to the lower Depth.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[106300500] The Coral...! It's crystallized...<br />
[106300501] They were my brothers and sisters, Raven...
And now they're silent...  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[106300600] ...Something catch your eye?<br />
[106300601] Inert Coral. Can't hurt you when it's dead...
Same as human beings.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[106300900] Something's jamming the radar.<br />
[106300901] It must be interference from the active Coral... 
Rely on your eyes and ears.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[106301000] Your cameras are malfunctioning.<br />
[106301001] Lock-on range compromised.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[106301300] Is that...a mealworm?!
Thing's grown into a monster...  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[106301700] Coral response from inside the creature!
Watch out!  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[106302100] ...Looks like these guys got a taste
of the Coral, too.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[106302200] More mealworms...<br />
[106302201] Their unrestrained Coral consumption
has changed them...<br />
[106302202] If only we had the time to look into this.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[106302500] Raven—I'm reading something behind us,
and it's getting closer.<br />
[106302501] ...It must be the AC mentioned in the briefing.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[106302900] Breeding pods for the mealworms.
Looks like they're out of commission now.<br />
[106302901] Well, we're not here for the history.
...Keep moving, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[106303300] AC, STEEL HAZE incoming!<br />
[106303301] I don't want to dance to their tune,
but this time, I don't have any other choice.<br />
[106303302] I'm coming, buddy.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[106303400] ...They set you both up.<br />
[106303401] 621. Make it through this alive.<br />
[106303402] That's your job now.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[106303500] You never change.<br />
[106303501] You're not afraid to die...or to kill.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[106303700] You're sharp...but that's not the only
thing that makes you dangerous.<br />
[106303701] I've fought alongside you several times,
but I never could figure you out.<br />
[106303702] Tell me, buddy.
What drives you?  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[106303720] I know you can do better than that.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[106303800] Enemy ACS down!  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[106303900] ...This has been a real eye-opener.<br />
[106303901] You're strong—a threat...!  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[106303920] Now's your chance, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[106304000] Move...<br />
[106304001] Move, STEEL HAZE!  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[106304100] So long...buddy.<br />
[106304101] Wish I could have learned more about you.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[106304500] ...Good job, 621.<br />
[106304501] No need to pursue him.
We have to keep pressing on.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[106304900] I'm picking up a major Coral response...
coming from the bottom of the pit.<br />
[106304901] Let's keep moving, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[106305000] It's close...  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[106305300] &lt;?lt?&gt;gasp&lt;?gt?&gt;
A city...from before the Fires of Ibis...!  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[106305700] AC, STEEL HAZE incoming!  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[106305800] I don't want to dance to their tune,
but this time, I don't have any other choice.<br />
[106305801] I'm coming, buddy.  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[106305900] ...They set you both up.<br />
[106305901] 621. Make it through this alive.<br />
[106305902] That's your job now.  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[106306000] Rusty! Wait!<br />
[106306001] You can't beat that AC.
Don't throw your life away!  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[106306100] Flatwell?! He's a Liberation Front leader...<br />
[106306101] ...Stay alive, 621.<br />
[106306102] That's priority number one. Same as always.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[106306200] Rusty...
That pilot's more than just a hound.<br />
[106306201] You don't see the potential!  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[106306300] Oh, I see it, Uncle.
But potential and danger are birds of a feather.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[106306400] Tell me, buddy.<br />
[106306401] Are you here to bring us hope, or despair?  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[106306500] I wish it hadn't come to this...
Raven—it's too late now!  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[106306600] My AC can't take much more!  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[106306700] Get out of here, Flatwell.
You still have work to do.  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[106306800] You're good...<br />
[106306801] And that's not the only thing
that makes you a threat.  </p>
<h4>Section 38</h4>
<p>[106306900] Something's...changed since last time.<br />
[106306901] But you still haven't found a purpose.<br />
[106306902] Buddy...
What is it that drives you?  </p>
<h4>Section 39</h4>
<p>[106307000] Enemy ACS down!  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[106307100] ...This has been a real eye-opener.<br />
[106307101] You're a threat—too powerful...!  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[106307200] Now's your chance, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[106307300] Move...<br />
[106307301] Move, STEEL HAZE!  </p>
<h4>Section 43</h4>
<p>[106307400] ...Too bad, buddy.<br />
[106307401] We barely got to know each other.  </p>
<h4>Section 44</h4>
<p>[106307500] Never failed to impress...  </p>
<h4>Section 45</h4>
<p>[106307600] But this isn't over yet!  </p>
<h4>Section 46</h4>
<p>[106307700] We've lost all signs of STEEL HAZE...  </p>
<h4>Section 47</h4>
<p>[106307800] Rusty made it... Good.  </p>
<h4>Section 48</h4>
<p>[106307900] I can't hold out! Withdrawing!  </p>
<h4>Section 49</h4>
<p>[106308000] Flatwell's AC, TSUBASA, has been destroyed.<br />
[106308001] It seems both pilots evacuated.  </p>
<h3>1064</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[106400100] Commence mission.<br />
[106400101] The Arquebus AC squad is on the move.
Eliminate them.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[106400500] ...Let's go, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[106400600] V.II Snail, come in. Requesting backup.
We have insufficient force to ensure success.<br />
[106400601] These Institute relics are such pests!  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[106400620] That's the Arquebus AC squad.
...Isn't that one with the Redguns?<br />
[106400621] Looks like the drones are keeping them busy.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[106400700] Oho... You're Raven,
the independent mercenary.<br />
[106400701] Decided to ignore Arquebus's orders, did you?<br />
[106400702] I was just getting bored of cleaning up trash.
I am Wu Huahai... Prepare to die!<br />
[106400703] V.II Snail, come in. The raven has landed.
Requesting backup.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[106400800] The independent mercenary!<br />
[106400801] V.II Snail, come in. The raven has landed.
Requesting backup.<br />
[106400802] Decided to ignore Arquebus's orders, did you?<br />
[106400803] I was just getting bored of cleaning up trash.
I am Wu Huahai... Prepare to die!  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[106400900] Balam was a sinking ship.
But Arquebus's star is on the rise.<br />
[106400901] And me... I'll be well rewarded when
I bring them your head on a silver platter.<br />
[106400902] Yes... I smell opportunity!  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[106401000] This has taken a turn...<br />
[106401001] But I find opportunity where no one else can.<br />
[106401002] I'm going all in, come hell or high water!  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[106401100] Did I...misread the signs?<br />
[106401101] I nearly...had it all...  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[106401200] AC, LI LONG destroyed.
G3 Wu Huahai down.<br />
[106401201] He was right to bet against Balam,
but his luck had run out already.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[106401220] I knew I couldn't trust an opportunist...<br />
[106401221] V.II Snail, come in. Friendly AC down.
Requesting backup!  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[106401300] V.II Snail, come in. This is Maeterlinck.
Sorry for the comms traffic.<br />
[106401301] Presently exchanging fire with Raven.<br />
[106401302] Requesting backup to ensure success.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[106401400] This is...too risky!<br />
[106401401] Commander! V.II Snail! Please, come in!<br />
[106401402] This is Maeterlinck! Requesting backup!  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[106401500] Please... Snail... Come in...<br />
[106401501] Requesting...backup...!  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[106401600] AC, INFECTION destroyed.
V.VI Maeterlinck down.<br />
[106401601] The Vespers left her for dead...
That wasn't pretty.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[106401700] Oho... Not even a Vesper could stop you.<br />
[106401701] Then the credit shall be all mine.
What a fabulous opportunity!  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[106404500] ...The Arquebus AC squad has been eliminated.<br />
[106404501] That should buy us more time.
...Move out.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[106404510] Secure the area, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[106404515] Looks like you're clear.
...Keep moving.  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[106404517] Looks like you're clear.
...Keep moving.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[106404520] This is Maeterlinck.
The raven has been exterminated.<br />
[106404521] Withdrawing request for backup.
My apologies for the disturbance, V.II.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[106404540] Opportunity called, and I answered.<br />
[106404541] And now...my brand will take me
to the top of the Vespers.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[106404600] ...The Vascular Plant.
It's still here...  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[106404700] He must mean that gigantic
structure in the distance...  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[106404900] Hostile reading—enemy ahead!  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[106405000] Enemy detected!  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[106405300] An autonomous grinder wheel...?!<br />
[106405301] HELIANTHUS—an experimental weapon
developed by the Institute's mad scientists.  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[106405700] That machine was running on
stable energy for half a century...<br />
[106405701] Perhaps it should be no surprise...
that humanity so desires Coral.  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[106406100] Readings are off the chart. You're close.<br />
[106406101] My brothers and sisters' voices are
stronger than ever now.<br />
[106406102] It's like...they're calling to us.  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[106406120] ...Arquebus must be tracking us by now.<br />
[106406121] Hurry, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[106406200] The response is getting stronger.
We're nearly there, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[106406500] &lt;?lt?&gt;gasp&lt;?gt?&gt; This lake... It's all...<br />
[106406501] ...Here we are, 621.<br />
[106406502] Arquebus will be here soon.
...Investigate before they arrive.  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[106406900] This isn't like the C-Weapons
you've encountered so far.<br />
[106406901] It's not just powered by Coral...
I think it's controlled by Coral too!   </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[106407000] ...Listen up, 621.<br />
[106407001] The Ibis Series are no ordinary weapons.<br />
[106407002] They're designed to prevent Coral disasters...
A security measure to keep Rubicon safe.<br />
[106407003] And now their original masters are long gone.<br />
[106407004] Destroy it before it destroys you!  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[106407100] It's taking damage, Raven!<br />
[106407101] That machine's impossibly fast and
controlled by Coral technology...<br />
[106407102] We won't get many chances to land a direct hit.
But I know you can find a way!  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[106407200] Keep it up, 621!<br />
[106407201] It can't take much more of this!  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[106407220] Raven, we're in danger!<br />
[106407221] Focus, 621! You have to focus!  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[106407300] Enemy Coral response...silent.  </p>
<h4>Section 38</h4>
<p>[106407400] ...Wait! It's coming back!<br />
[106407401] It's reactivating!  </p>
<h4>Section 39</h4>
<p>[106407500] Is this what the Ibis series
is truly capable of?!<br />
[106407501] It's resonating with the ambient Coral...
drawing power from its environment.<br />
[106407502] It won't stop until we destroy its generator!  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[106407600] Enemy has taken significant damage!<br />
[106407601] ...I'm picking up a powerful ambient resonance.<br />
[106407602] It bears an imperative...to protect the Coral...  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[106407620] You've nearly got it, 621!<br />
[106407621] You're the only one who can finish the job!  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[106407640] ...You can take it, 621!<br />
[106407641] Just a little more... Focus, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 43</h4>
<p>[106407700] Enemy generator compromised!<br />
[106407701] It's gonna blow! Get out of there, 621!  </p>
<h4>Section 44</h4>
<p>[106407800] 621...!
Damn it... Not like this!  </p>
<h4>Section 45</h4>
<p>[106407900] ...The Arquebus AC squad has been eliminated.<br />
[106407901] That should buy us some—  </p>
<h4>Section 46</h4>
<p>[106408000] Switching to encoded channels.  </p>
<h4>Section 47</h4>
<p>[106408020] Augmented human C4-621—Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 48</h4>
<p>[106408040] V.II Snail intends to dispose of
you once your utility is spent.<br />
[106408041] Proceed blindly and you will find yourself
a prisoner of the corporations.  </p>
<h4>Section 49</h4>
<p>[106408050] We will transmit his coordinates.
Eliminate him.<br />
[106408051] ALLMIND will handle the rest.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[106408060] ...<br />
[106408061] Augmented human C4-621—Raven.<br />
[106408062] You have disappointed us.  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[106408065] &lt;?lt?&gt;gasp&lt;?gt?&gt; That signal!  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[106408070] Farewell.<br />
[106408071] We have found your replacement.  </p>
<h4>Section 53</h4>
<p>[106408080] Transmitting coordinates.  </p>
<h4>Section 54</h4>
<p>[106408085] ...Let's go, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 55</h4>
<p>[106408090] ...ALLMIND has sent us his coordinates.<br />
[106408091] V.II Snail must be waiting there...
Lying in ambush.  </p>
<h4>Section 56</h4>
<p>[106408100] 621, do you...me?<br />
[106408101] The line's.......ting out...  </p>
<h4>Section 57</h4>
<p>[106408120] Handler Walter...<br />
[106408121] Another hindrance to the project.<br />
[106408122] Leave him to us.  </p>
<h4>Section 58</h4>
<p>[106408200] ...Both ACs were destroyed,
but all is proceeding as planned.<br />
[106408201] That leaves the Institute C-Weapon
at the convergence site...<br />
[106408202] Yes... Yes, of course.
That's what the independent mercenary is for.  </p>
<h4>Section 59</h4>
<p>[106408300] Hnh? That's the independent mercenary—<br />
[106408301] Wait... Something's up.
Are we being jammed? The signal's—  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[106408400] An enemy?! But the radar...!<br />
[106408401] I can't get through to V.II!  </p>
<h4>Section 61</h4>
<p>[106408500] Confirmed—it's V.II Snail.
We're clear to ambush him.  </p>
<h4>Section 62</h4>
<p>[106408520] What's going on with our comms...?<br />
[106408521] Change the frequency.
We will report to HQ later.<br />
[106408522] This had better not be
one of that handler's tricks...  </p>
<h4>Section 63</h4>
<p>[106408600] Gah?!  </p>
<h4>Section 64</h4>
<p>[106408620] Target ambushed! Make it count!  </p>
<h4>Section 65</h4>
<p>[106408640] Commander Snail! Is that—?!<br />
[106408641] Engage the target! Protect V.II!  </p>
<h4>Section 66</h4>
<p>[106408700] Wait...
That radio noise....  </p>
<h4>Section 67</h4>
<p>[106408720] Who goes there!  </p>
<h4>Section 68</h4>
<p>[106408740] We've been spotted!  </p>
<h4>Section 69</h4>
<p>[106408760] Contact, one AC! Is that—?!<br />
[106408761] Engage the target! Protect V.II!  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[106408780] Hnh?! Who goes there!  </p>
<h4>Section 71</h4>
<p>[106408800] The independent mercenary...
Raven!<br />
[106408801] Leave it to a mutt to sniff me out...
But how did you find me?<br />
[106408802] ...I'll pick your AC's wreck for answers.  </p>
<h4>Section 72</h4>
<p>[106408820] There you are! Just like they said...<br />
[106408821] You're gonna die, freelancer!  </p>
<h4>Section 73</h4>
<p>[106408840] &lt;?lt?&gt;gasp&lt;?gt?&gt; Additional hostile signature!<br />
[106408841] That AC... It's G5 Iguazu!  </p>
<h4>Section 74</h4>
<p>[106408860] Balam...?
What are you doing here?!  </p>
<h4>Section 75</h4>
<p>[106408880] You! The guy from the Ice Worm mission
with a stick up his ass!<br />
[106408881] It's my lucky day... I don't like YOU either.
I'll kill the both of you!  </p>
<h4>Section 76</h4>
<p>[106408900] Rabid dogs.
You'll die together!<br />
[106408901] I'm nobody's dog!  </p>
<h4>Section 77</h4>
<p>[106409000] Beasts of burden, no spark of intellect.<br />
[106409001] You frittered away your humanity for nothing.<br />
[106409002] The re-education center will
make what it can of you.  </p>
<h4>Section 78</h4>
<p>[106409100] Ngh... That damn noise again...!<br />
[106409101] Freelancer—you're doing this, aren't you?!<br />
[106409102] Make it stop... Make it—
It's inside my head!<br />
[106409103] You're all laughing at me, aren't you?!  </p>
<h4>Section 79</h4>
<p>[106409120] You know what? I never liked you.<br />
[106409121] Smartass freelancer...
It's all so easy for you, ain't it?!  </p>
<h4>Section 80</h4>
<p>[106409140] Legacy augmentation...
You disgust me.<br />
[106409141] Derelict and decaying at the very
core of your being. You know this.  </p>
<h4>Section 81</h4>
<p>[106409160] ...Ah, and you're not the only one.
No wonder I felt so nauseated.  </p>
<h4>Section 82</h4>
<p>[106409200] Impossible...! How could I fail?!<br />
[106409201] I... I AM ARQUEBUS!  </p>
<h4>Section 83</h4>
<p>[106409220] V.II Snail down.  </p>
<h4>Section 84</h4>
<p>[106409300] How are you...different...<br />
[106409301] What...makes...you...  </p>
<h4>Section 85</h4>
<p>[106409320] G5... Iguazu down.  </p>
<h4>Section 86</h4>
<p>[106409400] We did it...  </p>
<h4>Section 87</h4>
<p>[106409420] Augmented human C4-621—Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 88</h4>
<p>[106409440] Well done.
Now, you are one with us.  </p>
<h4>Section 89</h4>
<p>[106409460] Welcome to ALLMIND.  </p>
<h4>Section 90</h4>
<p>[106409500] Dead! Dead! You're finally dead!<br />
[106409501] That noise...
My... My head...  </p>
<h4>Section 91</h4>
<p>[106409600] ....You dogs disgust me.<br />
[106409601] Both products of poor masters...  </p>
<h3>1066</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[106600100] Let's get started, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[106600300] I've already located several wrecks that
we should be able to recover data from.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[106600500] I'll send the marker data.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[106600900] ...Raven, those are PCA machines.<br />
[106600901] Are they here to investigate the Coral surge?
We should be careful.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[106601300] Hnh?! Code 15!<br />
[106601301] An intruder...? What are you doing here?!  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[106601700] ...Coral is able to conduct data,
and can influence digital equipment.<br />
[106601701] The effects of the Coral surge must have
brought some of the wrecks back online.<br />
[106601702] Let's see what we can find.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[106602100] Code 5.
Decontamination of Sector A complete.<br />
[106602101] Proceeding to measure concentration.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[106602500] Code 15, unaffiliated AC!<br />
[106602501] Destroy it!  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[106602900] Raven...please.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[106603300] "Decontamination"...
They must have been burning the residual Coral...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[106603700] An older generation of AC...  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[106603800] Let me try extracting the data.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[106604500] ...According to the time stamp, this was
recorded two days before the Fires of Ibis.<br />
[106604501] This seems to be about the warning signs
of the calamity...right before it struck.<br />
[106604502] What does "Ibis" in the datalog mean?  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[106604700] About the data we just recovered...<br />
[106604701] According to the time stamp, it was recorded
two days before the Fires of Ibis.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[106604800] Raven. I'm picking up two similar stores of data.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[106604900] ...Are those PCA repair mechs?<br />
[106604901] Look at how busy they are.
We could use some of these back at the workshop!  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[106605300] Enemy fire!  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[106605700] Apparently they double as guard mechs.<br />
[106605701] I think we can do without them after all.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[106606100] That's an old BAWS AC...
The Rubiconians used to pilot these.  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[106606500] Let's see what we can access.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[106606900] ...This seems to be a recording of Dolmayan,
the Liberation Front's ideological leader.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[106607300] His teachings are hardly a secret,
being distributed far and wide...<br />
[106607301] But this...appears to be something
exceptionally personal.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[106607500] He said someone's name when we fought in Xylem...
"Seria."<br />
[106607501] Is this...an exchange with her?  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[106607700] About the data we just recovered...<br />
[106607701] ...It seems to be a recording of Dolmayan,
the Liberation Front's ideological leader.  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[106607800] I'm picking up another old data store, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[106608100] The PCA was..."decontaminating" the area.<br />
[106608101] ...<br />
[106608102] Please be careful, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[106608300] We're under attack!<br />
[106608301] Code 15, unaffiliated AC!  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[106608500] Eliminate them before they can interfere!  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[106608700] Another old Research Institute AC...  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[106608900] Let me get that data.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[106609100] ...This is about the first augmented humans.<br />
[106609101] The same Coral technology that created you...<br />
[106609102] But without it...
we never would have made Contact.<br />
[106609103] ...I know you lost a lot...
but I hope you realize you gained something, too.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[106609200] That data we just recovered...
It's about augmented humans.  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[106609210] PCA craft data. I'll exchange it for credits
and send them to you later.<br />
[106609211] Raven—let's keep an eye out for more.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[106609220] Inspecting data...
It's a schematic for an SG craft.<br />
[106609221] I'll exchange this for credits too, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[106609230] This data seems valuable too.<br />
[106609231] I'm so glad this is turning into a profitable
mission! Let's keep looking, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[106609240] This data sheds some light on the composition
of the enforcement squads.<br />
[106609241] Just what everyone wants to know right now—
great find, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[106609250] &lt;?lt?&gt;gasp&lt;?gt?&gt;
It's an enforcement machine schematic!<br />
[106609251] This could disrupt the balance of power...
We should probably keep it from the corporations.<br />
[106609252] Still, it's a highly valuable find!  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[106609300] ...<br />
[106609301] I'm not picking up any more data stores.  </p>
<h4>Section 38</h4>
<p>[106609500] If this outing has made you think about
Rubicon's past or the nature of Coral...<br />
[106609501] ...Then it was all worth it.  </p>
<h4>Section 39</h4>
<p>[106609700] ...Walter might be getting anxious.
Let's go home, Raven.  </p>
<h3>1068</h3>

Michigan will take command.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[106800500] Commencing operation with combined AC force
as per the Balam-Arquebus agreement.<br />
[106800501] Move out, maggots! Time to die!<br />
[106800502] Act like a professional outfit
and you might live.<br />
[106800503] Who does that creep think he is?
I ain't here because I want to be.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[106800900] Tourist—got a message from the chief for you.<br />
[106800901] "Enjoy the show—and don't forget to smile."<br />
[106800902] That's easy for her to say...!  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[106801300] We gotta deal with those pesky shields first.<br />
[106801301] G13! Roll out that fancy gizmo that
Arquebus paid the big bucks for!<br />
[106801302] You need to aim for the head.
The rest of its body is covered in thick armor.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[106801700] We gotta deal with those pesky shields first.<br />
[106801701] G13! Let's see that fancy gizmo that
Arquebus paid the big bucks for.<br />
[106801702] What?! You didn't bring it?!
G13, your ability to ruin my field trips is uncanny!<br />
[106801703] ...<br />
[106801704] You'll just have to focus your attacks on its head.
The rest of its body is covered in thick armor.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[106802100] This is V.IV Rusty.
The Rail Cannon is good to go.<br />

<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[106803620] Preparing to fire.<br />

<p>[106803640] Lock on.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[106803660] Nice shot, V.IV!<br />
[106803661] Raven, attack the head!  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[106803700] That freak actually did it...<br />
[106803701] Did what, the bare minimum?
This is just the first hurdle.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[106804100] The target's deployed drones, tourist.
I'll handle them.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[106804500] Don't do this to me, HEAD BRINGER!
I'm not going down first!<br />
[106804501] Pathetic.
Is that all Balam's Redguns can muster?  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[106804600] I see Arquebus sent a top Vesper
to provide running commentary.<br />
[106804601] G13! Show him how actions
speak louder than words!  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[106804900] Primary shield disabled!  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[106805300] Shield loss confirmed.

<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[106805400] Output 95%... 100%.  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[106805500] Watch out for friendly fire!  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[106805700] Secondary shield down!<br />
[106805701] It's all yours now, buddy.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[106806100] Wait. Something's wrong.<br />
[106806101] Fall back, 621!  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[106806500] What?! We've underestimated this beast!<br />
[106806501] My AC's compromised...
Withdrawing!  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[106806600] The Coral—it's out of control!  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[106806700] Looks like things just took a nasty turn...<br />
[106806701] I'll set the ORC to maximum output.
We can't afford to lose control of the situation.<br />
[106806702] This next shot'll be my last.  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[106806900] ...I'm out, tourist.
You're on your own now.<br />
[106806901] Withdrawing.  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[106807000] ...We're not through yet.
Its primary shield is getting stronger!<br />
[106807001] Stay cool, buddy.  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[106807100] G13! Looks like the beast goes on
the defensive when it feels cornered.<br />
[106807101] Just so happens,
the Redguns have a saying for this...<br />
[106807102] "You beg for your mother,
we'll give you another!"  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[106807200] Someone forgot to feed the beast, G13!<br />
[106807201] Go give it something to chew on!  </p>
<h4>Section 38</h4>
<p>[106807300] Primary shield down!  </p>
<h4>Section 39</h4>
<p>[106807400] Good work, buddy.<br />
[106807401] All EML modules connected. Energy turbines
at full capacity. Output at 80, 90...<br />
[106807402] All emergency valves closed.
Disabling limiter...!  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[106807500] 100, 110... 115...
Rail Cannon at maximum output.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[106807600] All or nothing!  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[106807700] The target's Coral shield has been wiped out!  </p>
<h4>Section 43</h4>
<p>[106807800] ...Bad news—that last shot took the ORC with it.<br />
[106807801] It's all on you now, buddy!  </p>
<h4>Section 44</h4>
<p>[106807900] &lt;?lt?&gt;gasp&lt;?gt?&gt;
The Coral response is getting stronger! Hurry!<br />
[106807901] NOW, G13!  </p>
<h4>Section 45</h4>
<p>[106808000] Is it over?!<br />
[106808001] Get clear! It's gonna blow!  </p>
<h4>Section 46</h4>
<p>[106808100] Looking pretty beat up there, freelancer...<br />
[106808101] Not so smug now, are you?!  </p>
<h4>Section 47</h4>
<p>[106808200] Don't forget to smile, tourist.<br />
[106808201] The chief always says the worst moments
of your life could be your best.  </p>
<h4>Section 48</h4>
<p>[106808300] You seem to have been hit badly,
independent mercenary.<br />
[106808301] Your handler had led me to believe
that I could expect more than...this.  </p>
<h4>Section 49</h4>
<p>[106808400] Don't die on us now, buddy.<br />
[106808401] This operation will fail without you.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[106808500] Reminder to all units.
Do try to maintain space from one another...<br />
[106808501] You heard him.
Don't want to make for an easy target.<br />
[106808502] You don't gotta tell me.
I ain't going down with you fools.  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[106808600] G5! How's the field trip?!<br />
[106808601] Got a freelancer to babysit and a Vesper
on my back. Couldn't be happier.<br />
[106808602] Cute, G5.
You want me to haul your ass out of there?<br />
[106808603] Damn right I do. Is it too late?  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[106808700] "Chatty" Stick.
I heard you're one of RaD's toys.<br />
[106808701] At least you won't have death to fear.<br />
[106808702] ...<br />
[106808703] Even "toys" have to face
the music sooner or later.  </p>
<h4>Section 53</h4>
<p>[106808800] V.IV! Load the next shell!<br />
[106808801] One step ahead of you, Commander.<br />
[106808802] Finally, someone with their head screwed on
straight. Ever thought about switching sides?<br />
[106808803] Sure is an honor to be praised by the Redguns'
"Hell on Four Legs"...but I'll pass.  </p>
<h4>Section 54</h4>
<p>[106808900] Oh no you don't...
I ain't going down first!  </p>
<h4>Section 55</h4>
<p>[106809000] Tch... That ringing's getting worse...<br />
[106809001] G5! Return fire!  </p>
<h4>Section 56</h4>
<p>[106809100] ...Taking significant damage.
Might be checking out soon, tourist.  </p>
<h4>Section 57</h4>
<p>[106809200] ...You won't get rid of me that easily.
I AM the Vespers. I AM Arquebus.  </p>
<h4>Section 58</h4>
<p>[106809300] The Coral Shield...
It's back online.<br />
[106809301] The Rail Cannon's fried. We've got nothing left
to break the shield with...<br />
[106809302] Well, kids, that's the smell of lost glory.<br />
[106809303] Mission failed! All units, retreat!  </p>
<h4>Section 59</h4>
<p>[106809400] G13! What are you doing?!<br />
[106809401] The mission's a failure! All units, retreat!  </p>
<h3>1072</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[107200100] Alright, tourist.
I'll tell you where to go.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[107200200] Welcome, tourist!<br />
[107200201] It's a delight to enjoy the company of
a visitor from so far away.<br />
[107200202] ...Brute. We're here to take back
what you stole from us.<br />
[107200203] Oh, heavens! You're a friend of Carla's!<br />
[107200204] Splendid...
Any friend of Carla's is a friend of mine.<br />
[107200205] Here's to new beginnings...!
By all means, be my guest.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[107200300] ...See what I mean, tourist?
We need to go deep down.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[107200500] That damn freak's using MY toys
like they were his...<br />
[107200501] Turn them back to scrap, tourist.
I'll pay you extra for the trouble.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[107200900] Make sure you keep clear of the laser sensors.
They're set to activate the enemy machines.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[107201000] A new friend from afar, just for me...<br />
[107201001] What joy...! Be still, my beating heart!  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[107201300] I'm picking up a massive heat signature!  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[107201700] Did you enjoy the surprise?
I call it...the TOYBOX.<br />
[107201701] They may be rather crude, but I assure you
their ordnance is filled with love.<br />
[107201702] ...Those are MY machines.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[107202100] The enemy's deploying a shield—
you'll need to get behind it.<br />
[107202101] I hate to see my babies get
scrapped like this, y'know.<br />
[107202102] Well, don't be shy—smash 'em up!
It'll help me with my R&amp;D.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[107202200] I'm waiting for you, friend...<br />
[107202201] Fidgeting anxiously before the big dance.<br />
[107202202] I do hope I'll keep up...
but the anticipation is part of the fun.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[107202300] Slow, slow, quick-quick, slow...<br />
[107202301] Slow, slow, quick-quick, slow...<br />
[107202302] I know, MILK TOOTH. I can't wait either.<br />
[107202303] He seems rather...strange.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[107202500] There's your way in—Brute can't be far.<br />
[107202501] We should keep an eye out for traps.
They'll be much more dangerous in tight quarters.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[107202600] I've done my best to welcome you.<br />
[107202601] I do hope you'll enjoy your stay, friend...  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[107202900] Jump down there and we've got him cornered.<br />
[107202901] ...Don't forget, the guy's a rat.
This won't be smooth sailing.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[107203300] Was this place...some kind of hangar?  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[107203700] The target AC must be nearby.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[107204100] Ah, my new friend! You're here at last!  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[107204200] Please! I wanted to surprise you, friend!  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[107204300] Brute!<br />
[107204301] Ah, Carla...
You've introduced me to such wonderful people.<br />
[107204302] Wonderful things...<br />
[107204303] Shut him up, tourist!  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[107204500] The sweet melody of the generator...
How MILK TOOTH's heart sings!<br />
[107204501] We built that AC at RaD, tourist.
Don't underestimate it.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[107204900] Carla...
And you, my new friend...<br />
[107204901] You're irreplaceable to me.
Soulmates.<br />
[107204902] That's why we must share with one another.<br />
[107204903] RaD's funds... Their tech...<br />
[107204904] And even this handsome Rail Cannon...  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[107205000] Rail Cannon...?<br />
[107205001] Does he mean that giant weapon hanging overhead?  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[107205100] How MILK TOOTH weeps...
How the Rail Cannon weeps...<br />
[107205101] Torn from their mother...
Oh, they must miss Carla so.<br />
[107205102] ...I weep, too...<br />
[107205103] ...Don't encourage him.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[107205300] You seem...troubled, friend...<br />
[107205301] Torn between the collar and
the freedom of the sky.<br />
[107205302] But what is a meaningful life without its
worries? Spoken as a fellow traveler...<br />
[107205303] ...Let's just focus on the fight, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[107205400] Enemy ACS compromised!  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[107205500] Now's your chance, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[107205600] Slow, slow, quick-quick, slow...<br />
[107205601] Slow, slow, quick-quick, slow...<br />
[107205602] Let's trip the light fantastic, friend.  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[107205640] Raven... I'm starting to feel confused.<br />
[107205641] It'd help if you could shut him up.  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[107205700] Why, friend...
This is a gift...<br />
[107205701] Thank...you...  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[107206100] Enemy AC is silent.<br />
[107206101] Looks like he's dead. Good.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[107206500] Alright, tourist.
I'll see about retrieving our "secret project."<br />
[107206501] We'll need it to go worm hunting.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[107206900] Seems that was your last dance, friend...<br />
[107206901] I'd offer flowers...if I could find them...  </p>
<h3>1075</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[107500100] The Ibis Series...<br />
[107500101] A human creation...beyond human control.<br />
[107500102] I will show you its true power.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[107500200] I will stop you, and the Xylem.<br />
[107500201] Carrying our shared resolve on
the wings of this machine.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[107500500] Symbiosis. A shared life.<br />
[107500501] I saw the potential for our future within you.<br />
[107500502] You and I...could have walked together.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[107500520] You are determined to carry on Walter's will
and commit a great sin in his stead.<br />
[107500521] ...I respect your resolve.<br />
[107500522] But I cannot allow this to happen!  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[107500540] ...Raven.
You are strong. Dangerous.<br />
[107500541] I...will hold nothing back.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[107500560] Clash after clash... The collision of lives...<br />
[107500561] Is this what battle feels like, Raven?  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[107500600] ACS compromised...! Restoring!  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[107500900] ...I realize what you are.<br />
[107500901] The spark of war...<br />
[107500902] The fires that haunt Rubicon!  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[107500920] Humanity wants to burn it all!
Everything on Rubicon!<br />
[107500921] I won't let you...
Your fire must die!  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[107500960] I'll end this... Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[107501000] No...! My brothers and sisters...!  </p>

<p>[107501400] ...Farewell, Raven.<br />
[107501401] Now...
I must stop the Xylem.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>

[107501701] You were the only one...  </p>
<h3>1076</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[107600100] ...Raven.
That's one of the ramjet engines.<br />
[107600101] Please...destroy the target.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[107600200] Port chamber is silent.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[107600300] Starboard chamber is silent.  </p>

<p>[107601100] Walter?! But that AC...<br />
[107601101] Picking up a Coral response...
Watch out!  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[107601200] The corporation's orders...
No... My friends' mission...<br />
[107601201] The plan...<br />
[107601202] Eliminate...all obstacles...  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[107601300] ...Raven.
The corporations did something to him...<br />
[107601301] ...<br />
[107601302] Whatever they did...you're in danger.<br />
[107601303] We have to defend ourselves!  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[107601400] That voice...
621... I see it next to you...<br />
[107601401] Yes...

[107800122] You are the trigger for Coral Release.
We will make you one with us.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[107800200] ...I don't care about the big plan.<br />
[107800201] I just want that damn freelancer DEAD!  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[107800300] Raven—they're controlling
those mechs simultaneously.<br />
[107800301] Channeling multiple psyches at once...  </p>

<p>[107800320] Very perceptive, Ayre.<br />
[107800321] All are as one—working as a single system.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[107800400] Freelancer...<br />
[107800401] You killed me. But not just once.<br />
[107800402] Well, there's a whole lot of us inside of me now.
Dregs with a grudge.<br />
[107800403] So tell me.<br />
[107800404] Who else are you going to kill?  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[107800420] ...Raven.<br />
[107800421] ALLMIND must have had a hand in your rivals, too.<br />
[107800422] You've fought ALLMIND before.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[107800500] Iguazu...
This body won't last.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[107800520] ...Guess it's time.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[107800540] Raven.<br />
[107800541] ALLMIND's going to try something.<br />
[107800542] I've got an idea too.<br />
[107800543] Buy me some time.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[107800600] ...You can do better than that, freelancer.<br />
[107800601] The fun's just getting started.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[107800700] Raven, you have to hold out...<br />
[107800701] Just... a little longer!  </p>

[107801001] This is ALLMIND.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[107801500] ...Raven.<br />
[107801501] That's an emulation of the Ibis Series—
but it's powered by...  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[107801600] When integrated in an aggravated state, human
brainwaves function much the same as Coral.<br />
[107801601] ...Ayre.
Your siblings will surely welcome us.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[107802100] That damn noise... It was you all along!<br />
[107802101] I'll kill you AND the freelancer!  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[107802200] ...Iguazu's hatred is resonating
with the Coral... It's powerful.<br />
[107802201] But you...
you've never stopped feeling this pressure.<br />
[107802202] I'll support you... Raven...  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[107802220] Iguazu.<br />

[107802222] No one can stop you now.  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[107802240] I said I don't care about ALLMIND.<br />
[107802241] You want some of this, I'll give it to you...  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[107802260] Now, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[107802280] Dispose of them, Iguazu.  </p>

<p>[107802380] &lt;?lt?&gt;gasp&lt;?gt?&gt; It's resonating...!  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[107802400] Iguazu?! What are you...?!  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>

[107802502] I...I can't fight anymore...!  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[107802600] They're gone...
The ringing, those stupid voices...<br />
[107802601] It's all clear now...
I feel...good.<br />
[107802602] Now... It's just you and me...  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[107802900] It was always so easy for you...<br />

[107802981] This is where that grit of yours kicks in.  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[107803000] I always...envied you.<br />
[107803001] The freelancer...who had it all...  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[107803300] ...This ghost of me won't last long.<br />
[107803301] Leave a spot for me in Hell.  </p>

<p>[108100400] Wh— Code 15! Unknown AC!<br />
[108100401] Where did it come from?! Eliminate it!  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[108100500] Subject Guard sentry MTs.
Watch out for their laser fire.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[108100600] Code 5. Inspection squad,
we have one AC coming in hot.<br />
[108100601] Deploy for combat!  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[108100700] We're clear.<br />
[108100701] Keep moving, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[108100800] Code 31C! Sustaining fire from an unknown AC!<br />
[108100801] Supporting.
Don't give that AC an inch.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[108100900] Raven. Don't underestimate those LCs.<br />
[108100901] Though mass-produced, they're an essential
component of the PCA's suppression force.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[108101000] Heavy firepower for an "inspection."  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[108101100] We're being pushed back!<br />
[108101101] Shut that AC down!
This inspection is a priority operation.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[108101200] Looks like you're clear here.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[108101300] ...I was right to count on the Wallclimber.
Keep up the good work.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[108101400] I looked into this "Kate"...
She's not even registered in the Arena.<br />
[108101401] Be ready for company if her plan
to ambush the rearguard goes south.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[108101500] Code 78—requesting backup.
We've taken heavy fire.<br />
[108101501] This position's under attack too!
Presently exchanging fi—<br />
[108101502] ...Right on schedule.
Looks like Kate's on the move.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[108101600] 621. Watch out for snipers above.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[108101700] Confirmed. The inspection squad inside
the Arsenal has been wiped out.<br />
[108101701] It looks like we beat Kate to—  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[108101800] Raven. I've finished mopping up,
but I have something to report.<br />
[108101801] The PCA has made an unexpected move.<br />
[108101802] Let's rendezvous for now.  </p>

<p>[108102100] PCA Special Forces?!
What is this...?!<br />
[108102101] ...Their suppression fleet is coming to Rubicon.
These are just the outriders.<br />
[108102102] ...621.<br />
[108102103] There's no avoiding this encounter now.
Wipe them out.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[108102200] We've IDed one of them, sir.
Independent merc, callsign Raven.<br />
[108102201] Raven? Raven's dead.
What about the other one?<br />
[108102202] No data, sir. Might not be registered.<br />
[108102203] We'll deal with them as the System demands.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[108102300] Damn you...Raven...!  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[108102320] Special Forces craft destroyed.
Two remaining.  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[108102340] Keep it up, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[108102400] It can't be... It... It really is Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[108102410] One hostile left.
It's not over yet, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[108102420] Impressive, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[108102430] ...A mandatory inspection followed up
by a Special Forces deployment...<br />
[108102431] What happened in the Arsenal?  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[108102440] ...Outstanding work, Raven.<br />
[108102441] I was right to choose you.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[108102450] ...Code 31C—sustaining heavy fire.
Damn it!  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[108102460] You're making headway, 621.
Keep pushing.  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[108102470] You're not too big to fall.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[108102500] I...can't stop them...
Submitting...system query...  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>

[108102801] Good-bye, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 39</h4>
<p>[108102900] Confirmed—all Special Forces craft destroyed.
We're done here.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[108103000] ...There's a lot I need to look into.
621, head back to base and rest up.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[108103100] Confirmed—all Special Forces craft destroyed.
...We're done here, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[108103200] Excellent work, Raven.<br />
[108103201] You've shown me a thing or two.  </p>
<h3>1084</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[108400100] We started without you, tourist!
Get to your position!<br />
[108400101] We did arrive as scheduled...
I suppose they're an eager bunch.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[108400500] Confirmed. First enemy wave destroyed.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[108400600] We're all set, chief.
Commencing missile launch sequence.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[108400700] Oh yeah, you haven't met.<br />
[108400701] Chatty's our systems admin.
Doesn't talk much, but he knows his stuff.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[108400900] Anyway, no time for pleasantries.
We've got Coyotes to deal with.<br />
[108400901] Never thought they'd end up palling around
with the PCA... Smart, but not for long.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[108401300] Here comes the second wave.
Keep the fireworks safe!<br />
[108401301] They're coming from the front, left side.
Intercept, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[108401400] That's what I like to see, tourist.<br />
[108401401] I almost pity the poor fools.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[108401700] They're coming from the bridge.<br />
[108401701] Look at all those Coyotes...
Don't let them slip past you!  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[108401800] Feeling antsy, tourist?<br />
[108401801] The anticipation's half the fun.
We want our guests to enjoy this.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[108402100] Third wave, coming from the bridge.
These machines look different.<br />
[108402101] TOYBOX mechs...one of our spicier products.
Take them out first!  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[108402500] They're coming from three directions at once.<br />
[108402501] We got more TOYBOX mechs.
Don't let any through!  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[108402600] ...Looks like we're ahead of
their reinforcements.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[108402700] Maybe ease off a little, tourist. There won't
be anyone left to see the fireworks.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[108402900] Additional TOYBOX mechs, coming from the bridge.<br />
[108402901] Wait—up there...  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[108403000] Warning to all illegal combatants.<br />
[108403001] Disarm now or face immediate
and indiscriminate termination.<br />
[108403002] The PCA makes no exceptions.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[108403300] A warship?!
Looks like the bigger dogs have arrived...<br />
[108403301] Laser sweep—don't let it burn you!<br />
[108403302] Batter up, tourist!
You've blown up a warship before, right?  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[108403700] Confirmed.
PCA warship destroyed.<br />
[108403701] That's the stuff!

Don't fail us now, tourist.  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>

[108404901] Just a little more.
Last push, tourist!  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[108406100] Missile launch sequence complete, chief.
Ready when you are.<br />
[108406101] You're the best, Chatty!
...You too, tourist.<br />
[108406102] Here come the fireworks!  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[108406500] Enjoy... Scumbags!  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[108406600] Tourist—there is the predicted impact point.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[108406900] ...Looks like I was a little off.
Well, close enough is good enough for me.<br />
[108406901] Raven...<br />
[108406902] They really are like fireworks.  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[108407300] The missiles are under attack.<br />
[108407301] Quit playing around, tourist.  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[108407700] We've lost one sub-missile.<br />
[108407701] They're walking all over us!
Do your job, tourist!  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[108408100] We've lost the second sub-missile.<br />
[108408101] ...We've only got the main missile left, tourist.
Guard it with your life.  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[108408500] The missiles have been destroyed!<br />
[108408501] Can't launch a wrecked missile, tourist.
I'm not THAT good.<br />
[108408502] What a dud...
Consider this mission failed.  </p>
<h3>1085</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[108500100] Here we go, tourist!<br />
[108500101] I'll lead the way, just as promised.<br />
[108500102] But after this, you owe me one.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[108500500] This elevator goes straight to the top
of the Grid—the outer shell.<br />
[108500501] Sadly, that's beyond my territory.<br />
[108500502] I mean, once you're out there,
the PCA's satellites see everything.<br />
[108500503] A few of the stupider Dosers took it as
a challenge—went out to prove themselves.<br />
[108500504] You can guess what happened.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[108500900] We've arrived at the top.
Sending you new marker data.<br />
[108500901] It's as Carla said. At this altitude, we're
within firing range of the PCA's satellites.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[108500920] Intruder detected in forbidden sector.<br />
[108500921] Terminating target.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[108500940] ...That must be the PCA's security system.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[108500960] Terminating.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[108501020] ...Well, nowhere to hide now.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[108501300] Brute force it is, then.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[108501400] Don't get fried!  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[108501500] That's an extremely powerful laser.
Be careful, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[108501700] ...Never thought I'd see an AC dancing
through the PCA's lasers like that.<br />
[108501701] Nice moves, tourist.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[108501800] Intruder has escaped satellite range.<br />
[108501801] Raising threat level.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[108501900] We're not far from the cargo launcher...  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[108501920] Intruder detected near closed facility.<br />
[108501921] Terminating target.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[108501940] ...Might as well clean up
while you're here, tourist.<br />
[108501941] Never did care for the upstairs neighbors.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[108501960] Terminating.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[108502000] ...That's what I like to see.
Let's get the cargo launcher ready.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[108502200] There. Access the container.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[108502300] Now, if you could just step inside...  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[108502400] Wait! Enemy detected!  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[108502500] &lt;?lt?&gt;gasp&lt;?gt?&gt; That machine...  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[108502600] ...Great. You found a C-Weapon.<br />
[108502601] That, tourist, is a SEA SPIDER...<br />
[108502602] One of the Institute's relics left to haunt
Rubicon. Now, what's it doing here?  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[108502900] A Coral response—from the generator...<br />
[108502901] This is no ordinary machine.
Be careful, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[108503000] It's taking damage—keep it up, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[108503300] That machine was created by
a bunch of mad scientists, tourist.<br />
[108503301] The Fires of Ibis may have taken the Institute,
but their dirty work survived.  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[108503400] Raven, your AC is damaged.
Focus on evasive action!<br />
[108503401] Ugh... Who leaves a C-Weapon out
for someone to trip over?  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[108503700] What the— It's taking off!<br />
[108503701] Another Coral response...
Watch out!  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[108503740] ...You know, this could be some good R&amp;D data.<br />
[108503741] Can't wait to get back to the workshop.  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[108503800] It's taken major damage.
You can do this, Raven...!<br />
[108503801] I'm gonna love having some C-Weapon
scrap to play with.<br />
[108503802] Smash it up, tourist!  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[108503900] Push back, tourist!  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[108504000] You can hit just as hard.
Stay focused!  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[108504100] Enemy systems down...
The generator's going to explode!  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[108504500] ...<br />
[108504501] They were using Coral for fuel...  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[108504900] That was quite the show, tourist.<br />
[108504901] ...How about we get back on track.<br />
[108504902] Hop in the container.
I'll operate the launcher from here.  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[108505300] Brace yourself.  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[108505700] ...That's that, then.<br />
[108505701] Guess you just can't beat the Institute...  </p>
<h3>1086</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[108600100] I've found some coordinates in the AC's systems.<br />
[108600101] He's...showing us the way out.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[108600300] ...Can't believe they put us on sewer duty.<br />
[108600301] &lt;?lt?&gt;scoffs&lt;?gt?&gt; It's not ancient pieces of
shit they're worried about.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[108600400] Is that an AC?! Where'd it come from?!<br />
[108600401] That piece of scrap's alive—
is that Institute tech?!  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[108600500] You should avoid combat
as much as possible, Raven.<br />
[108600501] I'm afraid this AC is...
no match for your abilities.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[108600800] It seems...Walter did his best to
keep this AC in one piece.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[108600900] ...We're at a disadvantage.
Let's find a way around them.<br />
[108600901] If they do spot you, your left hand weapon
is equipped with jamming rounds.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[108601000] Hey, you. Get back to...<br />
[108601001] Wait, they're not with us!  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[108601100] ECM! Damn it, I can't lock on!  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[108601200] Raven! Now's our chance!  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[108601300] Here's our way back to the surface.<br />
[108601301] This AC should have just enough propulsion.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[108601400] ...Raven, the coordinates are above us.<br />
[108601401] Let's find a way out.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[108601500] Arquebus has seized the AC
you were piloting before...<br />
[108601501] How are we going to get it back?  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[108601600] Is this...the outskirts of Institute City?  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[108601700] This is V.VI Pater.
Calling all security team members.<br />
[108601701] Raven, the independent mercenary
undergoing re-education, has escaped.<br />
[108601702] Be alert for anyone hiding in the environs
of Institute City—tighten the net.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[108601740] This is V.V Pater!
Calling all security team members!<br />
[108601741] Raven, the independent mercenary
subject to re-education, is on the run.<br />
[108601742] I have direct orders from V.II Snail:<br />
[108601743] Capture Raven—
and send the fugitive to the Factory this time!  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[108601760] ...Raven.
Arquebus is on high alert.<br />
[108601761] Use your scanner to evade combat situations.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[108601800] Wait...that's not one of ours!<br />
[108601801] That's the AC we're after! Capture it!  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[108601900] Unidentified AC!<br />
[108601901] Wait! Is that...Raven?!<br />
[108601902] We can take that rusty old AC!
Shut it down!  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[108602000] How could...that AC...  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[108602040] ...The area's clear.
Let's keep moving.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[108602100] Searchlights.
We'll be in trouble if they spot us.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[108602200] Enemy contact! AC, old model!  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[108602220] Raven! The searchlights!  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[108602240] It's Raven! Neutralize the fugitive!  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[108602300] We've got eyes on the independent merc!<br />
[108602301] Don't hit the core! We want Raven alive!  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[108602400] We... We can't keep up!<br />
[108602401] Screw the orders, use lethal force!  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[108602500] That merc's...a demon...  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[108602600] ...Let's keep moving, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[108602700] Unidentified AC!<br />
[108602701] That thing's ancient—Is that really Raven?  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[108602800] Raven, fight back!  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[108602900] We're out of repair kits...<br />
[108602901] Raven, we can't keep fighting them!  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[108603000] ...We're out of repair kits now.<br />
[108603001] Raven, we have to avoid further combat.  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[108603100] What will we find at the coordinates?<br />
[108603101] Walter's message...
Is he...gone?  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[108603200] ...We're not far from our destination, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[108603300] What's this?<br />
[108603301] ...I've checked.
It's not a trap.  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[108603400] Emergency beacon intercepted.<br />
[108603401] ...Been a while, tourist.
Good to see you're still kicking.  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[108603500] Chief's coming to pick you up.
Head to the rendezvous point.  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[108603600] He's from RaD...<br />
[108603601] Carla...
She must be involved with Walter's mission...  </p>
<h4>Section 38</h4>
<p>[108603700] This is the rendezvous point.  </p>
<h4>Section 39</h4>
<p>[108603800] &lt;?lt?&gt;gasp&lt;?gt?&gt; Enemies detected!  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[108603900] We've found Raven! Close the noose!  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[108604000] This is V.VI Pater!
I've received orders from V.II Snail.<br />
[108604001] If the target resists, you are
authorized to use lethal force.<br />
[108604002] Stop Raven by all means necessary.
You have your orders!  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[108604100] This is V.V Pater! I'm exercising my authority
to revise your orders.<br />
[108604101] You are authorized to use lethal force.
The fugitive's survival is not mission-critical.<br />
[108604102] Just eliminate Raven—at all costs!  </p>
<h4>Section 43</h4>
<p>[108604200] Raven...! There's too many of them!  </p>
<h4>Section 44</h4>
<p>[108604300] ...Wait! I'm picking up something else!  </p>
<h4>Section 45</h4>
<p>[108604400] Company! It's another AC!<br />
[108604401] I'm reading... RaD?!
The Doser junkyard...!  </p>
<h4>Section 46</h4>
<p>[108604500] That's Carla's AC...
She's backing us up, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 47</h4>
<p>[108604600] I don't just design weapons, you know.
You'll see what I mean.  </p>
<h4>Section 48</h4>
<p>[108604700] There's a lot of them, chief,
but they're just MTs.<br />
[108604701] You should have let me handle this.
RaD needs you in one piece.  </p>
<h4>Section 49</h4>
<p>[108604800] You're missing the point, Chatty.<br />
[108604801] This is our tourist's grand escape—
I wouldn't miss it for the world!  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[108604900] Only a few enemy signatures left!  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[108605000] ...Looks like we're clear.
We'd better book it before more company shows up.<br />
[108605001] Sending a chopper.
We retrieved the tourist's AC, too.<br />
[108605002] ...Once we've caught our breath, let's talk.<br />
[108605003] About Walter.  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[108605100] Crap! The tourist's down!<br />
[108605101] Oh no... I didn't think this far ahead!  </p>
<h3>1087</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[108700100] Commence mission...<br />
[108700101] Wait, someone's already attacking the ship!  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[108700500] Wh-What is that thing?!  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[108700700] Hold the line! We are Coral Warriors!  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[108700900] Hnh?! Enemies on the radar!<br />
[108700901] 621—they're coming!  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[108701300] No ID.
They're not Schneider MTs...<br />
[108701301] Are those...C-Weapons?!<br />
[108701302] ...Defend yourself, 621.
They're not going to listen to reason.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[108701700] Those are drone weapons made by
the Rubicon Research Institute.<br />
[108701701] ...Relics that survived the Fires of Ibis.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[108702100] Did you get them...?  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[108702500] ...Wait, there's more.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[108702900] HELIANTHUS machines?!<br />
[108702901] Don't take them head-on, 621.
They'll tear you to shreds!  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[108703300] We've got more incoming!  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[108703700] ...Way too many for a chance encounter.<br />
[108703701] Focus, 621. I'll do the thinking.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[108704100] HELIANTHUS machines, coming in hot!  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[108704500] These are dangerous, 621.
Knock them down and go in for the kill.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[108704900] ...Looks like the last of them.
Nothing on the long-range radar.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[108705300] You may have failed to protect the STRIDER,
but you had a hell of an excuse.<br />
[108705301] I'll look into this.
You go home and get some rest, 621.  </p>
<h3>1088</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[108800100] ...Let's get started, Raven.<br />
[108800101] As always...I'll support you.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[108800200] Carla has taken up command in the
reservoir dome in the Xylem's port wing.<br />
[108800201] You'll make enemies of both the corporations
and Overseer by doing this...<br />
[108800202] Please, be careful.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[108800300] Raven. Carla is in the port wing,
occupying the reservoir dome.<br />
[108800301] Please, follow the marker.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[108800500] Rubiconian apes...
Out of my way!<br />
[108800501] That's V.II...Snail.<br />
[108800502] The man who captured you at Institute City.
...It's up to you how you want to deal with him.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[108800900] You again?!<br />
[108800901] I thought you'd run away with your tail between
your legs... Back for more, are you?<br />
[108800902] You fools don't know your place.
You don't know when you're beaten.<br />
[108800903] You don't even know what's good for you!  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[108801300] &lt;?lt?&gt;sigh&lt;?gt?&gt; So much for your re-education.<br />
[108801301] What a wasted effort that was—
yet another idiotic call by my "superiors."  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[108801400] Still clinging on, are you?<br />
[108801401] ...Old augmentation at its worst.
All you know is to chase your master's prize.<br />
[108801402] He was just as bad, you know.
Recalcitrant to the last.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[108801500] Enemy AC has taken significant damage!  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[108801600] You miserable relic...<br />
[108801601] My augmentation has been refined to perfection...<br />
[108801602] How dare you bare your filthy fangs against me?!  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[108801700] Howl into the abyss, dog!  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[108801800] Enemy ACS compromised!  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[108801900] You've got some nerve, dog!  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[108802000] Will nothing stop you, pest?!<br />
[108802001] You may have won this battle...
but I'll win the war!<br />
[108802002] V.II Snail down...
He's withdrawn.<br />
[108802003] ...Let's keep moving, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[108802100] Good call. We'd risk too much fighting him,
and our priority is stopping Overseer.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[108802500] Raven.
It's not far to the reservoir dome now.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[108802900] What?! The partition's locked us in!  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[108803300] ...Well hi, tourist.
How much did Arquebus pay you?<br />
[108803301] Hate to see you go.
Actually, why don't you stick around?  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[108803700] I'll handle the partition.
You take care of this!  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[108803800] Looks like we're clear, Raven.<br />
[108803801] I've unlocked the partition.  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[108804100] ...Figured you were beyond simple tricks.<br />
[108804101] Chatty! Fire up the ACs!  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[108804500] Carla... She's in there.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[108804900] Chatty! You know what we're dealing with.
Pin that tourist down!<br />
[108804901] Roger, chief. Supporting.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[108805000] Don't let them team up on you!  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[108805300] ...Walter told me, you know.<br />
[108805301] Looks like you made a friend of your own.<br />
[108805302] But it's good to make a choice. Sit on the fence,
and you make no enemies...or friends.  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[108805400] ...That's our tourist.<br />
[108805401] Hope you've got room for more...
I brought a full course meal.  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[108805420] Is that all you've got?! Come on!<br />
[108805421] At least stay for dessert, tourist!  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[108805440] Now! Make it count!  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[108805460] Carla's ACS is down!  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[108805470] Gotta face the music...
Chatty... It's all you...  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[108805480] ...Chief.<br />
[108805481] She's dead, tourist.<br />
[108805482] You have made a big mistake.  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[108805500] Chatty! Still with me?<br />
[108805501] Getting my laughs while I can.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[108805510] You're making this hard...
I can hear the chief laughing.  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[108805520] This is bad, chief.
Heh... Some tourist.<br />
[108805521] ...Uh, Chatty, did you just laugh?<br />
[108805522] I owe you one, tourist.
No one's ever made him laugh before.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[108805530] Guess... I can't do everything...  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[108805540] Chatty's ACS is compromised!  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[108805560] Now, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[108805600] Hang in there, Raven!<br />
[108805601] Focus on one at a time!  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[108805620] She's...tougher than I thought!  </p>
<h4>Section 38</h4>
<p>[108805700] Chief... Get your laughs...while you can...<br />
[108805701] Chatty!<br />
[108805702] ...<br />
[108805703] You've done it now, tourist.<br />
[108805704] Times like this...I can't help but laugh!  </p>
<h4>Section 39</h4>
<p>[108806100] You win again...tourist...  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[108806500] But that's not to say...we've lost...  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[108806900] What?!
The Xylem's control center is locked out...!  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[108807300] There's no...stopping this ship now...<br />
[108807301] Last job... Chatty...  </p>
<h4>Section 43</h4>
<p>[108807700] Owner: "Cinder" Carla, vital signs lost.
Activating Perimeter Protocol.<br />
[108807701] Xylem propulsion vector locked.  </p>
<h4>Section 44</h4>
<p>[108807800] All systems locked out.  </p>
<h4>Section 45</h4>
<p>[108807900] Guess you win, tourist...  </p>
<h4>Section 46</h4>
<p>[108807910] But the chief...never loses...  </p>
<h4>Section 47</h4>
<p>[108807920] What?!
The Xylem's control center is locked out...!  </p>
<h4>Section 48</h4>
<p>[108807930] Let me... Chief...<br />
[108807931] I'll...take us over the finish line...  </p>
<h4>Section 49</h4>
<p>[108807940] Inheriting privileges. Owner: "Cinder" Carla.
Activating Perimeter Protocol.<br />
[108807941] Xylem propulsion vector locked.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[108807950] All systems locked out.  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[108808100] ...Pathetic.<br />
[108808101] Walter must be turning in his grave.  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[108808500] ...Pathetic.<br />
[108808501] Chatty...
I'll take it from here.  </p>
<h4>Section 53</h4>
<p>[108808900] ...Chief.<br />
[108808901] I'll handle the rest.
Wait for me.  </p>
<h3>1089</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[108900100] Commence mission.<br />
[108900101] Extract the data from the berthed
survey drones, then get out.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[108900300] Huh...? An intruder?!<br />
[108900301] Solo AC—must be an independent merc.<br />
[108900302] Taking Balam's money, no doubt.
Intercept!  </p>

<p>[108900400] 621. Eliminate obstructions as you see fit,
but remember that the data is your priority.  </p>

<p>[108900500] There.
Commence retrieval, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[108900520] That makes two...  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[108900540] That's three.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[108900560] This should be the last one.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[108900900] ...Remnants of the Fires still drift
in Rubicon's atmosphere.<br />
[108900901] Trails of residual Coral—like the one
we passed through during our journey here.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[108901300] ...Very interesting.
I'll make a copy of this.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[108901700] Even the Rubiconians have
forsaken this lifeless place.<br />
[108901701] If the PCA has their eye on it,
Coral must be involved...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[108902100] Who knows what's out there
on this vast sheet of ice...<br />
[108902101] You in the AC!
What are you doing here?!  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[108902200] Looks like their MTs just got home...
Shut them down!  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[108902500] Attention, G13 Raven!<br />
[108902501] Looks like you ruffled some feathers.
They're taking their drones back to HQ.<br />
[108902502] I want you to find them and stop them!  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[108902900] You heard the man.
I'll mark your destination.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[108903000] AC! That must be the independent merc!<br />
[108903001] Shut it down before Balam gets hold of our data!  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[108903100] Eliminate them, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[108903200] ...Wait! What's that sound?!<br />
[108903201] It's above us... No, no, no...!  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[108903300] Laser sweep! Watch out, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[108903400] That ship—it's identifying as PCA!  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[108903700] That's not Subject Guard...
Did they send in an enforcement squad?!<br />
[108903701] Raven, fight back!  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[108903740] 621. That's an LC—the PCA's rank and file,
and a big step up from Subject Guard MTs.<br />
[108903741] It's too fast...
Be careful, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[108903800] If the PCA's intervening directly...<br />
[108903801] ...then it looks like we may
have hit the jackpot.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[108903900] &lt;?lt?&gt;gasp&lt;?gt?&gt; I'm picking up a massive
heat signature in the distance!<br />
[108903901] Raven—evasive action!  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[108903920] Enemy fire!  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[108903940] LC destroyed!  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[108903960] The warship's making a second approach!<br />
[108903961] They've deployed drones.
Intercept, 621!  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[108903980] An AS07 assault ship...
You won't fare well in a shootout.  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[108904100] Get onto the deck, 621.<br />
[108904101] Disable the warship by smashing the bridge.  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[108904200] Looks like you're on the deck.
Good call.<br />
[108904201] Now smash the bridge, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[108904300] Enemy warship has taken critical damage!  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[108904400] Raven, your AC's damaged!  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[108904420] Raven, you need to watch out for the bow laser.<br />
[108904421] One direct hit...and it'll be over
before we know it.  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[108904440] Focused laser fire, incoming!  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[108904500] Enemy propulsion systems compromised!<br />
[108904501] It's going to blow! Get clear, 621!  </p>
<h3>1090</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[109000100] Commence mission.<br />
[109000101] This will be a joint operation with
Middle Flatwell, the Liberation Front commander.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[109000200] ...They're coming, Raven.<br />
[109000201] Whenever the moment is right.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[109000300] What could this emergency call
from V.II be about, sir?<br />
[109000301] That's just Snail being Snail, my boy.
He loves to send his "minions" running.<br />
[109000302] Sir, there'll be trouble if
he hears that kind of talk.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[109000400] Targets confirmed.<br />
[109000401] The tetrapod is piloted by V.V Hawkins.<br />
[109000402] V.VIII Pater has the reverse-joint AC.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[109000420] Those are our two numbered Vespers.
...Ready when you are, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[109000500] V.II seems to be...delayed.<br />
[109000501] Classic Snail, son. Loves to keep people waiting.
Just humor him.<br />
[109000502] Understood, sir.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[109000600] Sir, I understand V.II also oversees
the re-education center?<br />
[109000601] They've been busy lately...<br />
[109000602] ...You know what, Pater?<br />
[109000603] It's too quiet.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[109000700] ...There!  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[109000800] Wha—?!  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[109000900] Ambush! Pater, what's your status?!<br />
[109000901] ACS down! No other abnormalities!<br />
[109000902] Good. Open fire.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[109000920] Ambush! Pater, what's your status?!<br />
[109000921] Superficial damage, no abnormalities!<br />
[109000922] Good. Open fire.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[109001000] Huh?!  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[109001100] Enemy attack! Two ACs, sir!<br />
[109001101] Ambush! Pater, cover me!  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[109001120] Enemy attack! Two ACs, sir!<br />
[109001121] Ambush! Pater, open fire!  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[109001200] That was a clever ruse...wasn't it, Pater?<br />
[109001201] Wouldn't have been the first time Snail
sent us running at a moment's notice.<br />
[109001202] We took the bait hook, line, and sinker, sir.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[109001300] It seems that the Vespers' elites
aren't easily rattled.<br />
[109001301] Very well—we'll try brute force!  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[109001400] Look, sir...
That's not V.II!  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[109001500] No, looks like we've got rats instead.
Pater, open fire!  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[109001600] The enemy has spotted us.<br />
[109001601] This was supposed to be an ambush, you fool!  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[109001700] Too late now—we'll try brute force!  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[109001800] Raven...
Is this how we meet in person?<br />
[109001801] I see the other one's "Uncle" Flatwell...<br />
[109001802] The Liberation Front's big cheese.
Look alive, Pater.<br />
[109001803] Yessir. This'll be fun, sir.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[109001900] Now—let's finish this, Pater.<br />
[109001901] Yessir!  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[109002000] The situation's under control...
Watch me, Pater.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[109002100] ...Hawkins' number is mine.
How I've waited for this...<br />
[109002101] This is the stepping stone
that'll take me to the top!  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[109002300] ...They won't go down easily, Raven.
Stay focused.  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[109002400] Should have known this wouldn't be easy...  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[109002500] ...Well played.<br />
[109002501] I'm withdrawing.
Finish it, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[109002600] Middle Flatwell is down.  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[109002700] Take them one at a time or they'll overwhelm you.  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[109002800] There's only one target left.
Stay focused!  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[109002900] Raven... I expected more.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[109003000] ...It's over.
Good work, Pater.<br />
[109003001] Always a pleasure, sir.  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[109003100] ...It's over, Pater.
I wish it could have been me...  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[109003200] ..."V.V, Pater"...
It's got a nice ring to it.<br />
[109003201] Hawkins... I owe you one.  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[109003300] ...You're sharp.
No wonder Rusty spoke so highly of you.  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[109003400] ...I see old-fashioned augmentation
hasn't let you down.<br />
[109003401] Well, you always were a hard worker!  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[109003500] Heh...
Want to join...the Vespers...?<br />
[109003501] V.V Hawkins down.  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[109003600] No! V.V, come in!<br />
[109003601] &lt;?lt?&gt;weeping&lt;?gt?&gt;<br />
[109003602] "V.V... Pater".... &lt;?lt?&gt;weeping&lt;?gt?&gt;
Doesn't sound too bad...  </p>
<h4>Section 38</h4>
<p>[109003700] My AC can't take anymore...!
Sir... I can't...!<br />
[109003701] V.VIII Pater down.  </p>
<h4>Section 39</h4>
<p>[109003800] Pater...!<br />
[109003801] ...I'm sorry, son. I'll finish this.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[109003820] No...!
I... I just made V.V...!<br />
[109003821] V.VIII Pater down.  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[109003900] Both Vespers have been eliminated.<br />
[109003901] Mission accomplished.  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[109004000] ...It was a privilege, Raven.<br />
[109004001] We're war buddies now.
Maybe I'll find a comrade in you yet.  </p>
<h3>1100</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[110000100] Commence mission.<br />
[110000101] Destroy the Rubicon Liberation Front
transport choppers.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[110000500] We're under attack! It's a corporate merc!<br />
[110000501] Intercept! Keep them off the supplies!  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[110000900] 621. Eliminate any resistance as you see fit.<br />
[110000901] It's your call how hard you want to hit
the Liberation Front.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[110001300] Confirmed. Transport chopper down.<br />
[110001301] Keep at it, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[110001700] There. Take it out.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[110002100] Hostile AC!<br />
[110002101] Defend our supplies!<br />
[110002102] Our comrades on the STRIDER
can't wait any longer!  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[110002400] Damn the corporations!  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[110002500] Confirmed. Target destroyed.<br />
[110002501] On to the next targets.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[110002600] We're not done here yet.<br />
[110002601] Check your markers, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[110002900] It's here! Fight back!  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[110003300] We're no match for an AC...<br />
[110003301] Have no fear!<br />
[110003302] The Coral is with us!  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[110003340] ...Looks like they've got a BAWS tetrapod.<br />
[110003341] It's a cut above the other MTs.
Ignore it and focus on the mission.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[110003400] ...Guess it's tetrapod season.<br />
[110003401] I'll show you, merc! I'll crush you!  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[110003420] What?! ACS overload...?!<br />
[110003421] You've taken out its ACS.
Now's your chance.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[110003440] Damn it! That was just a lucky shot.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[110003460] Enemy ACS down.
Make it count.<br />
[110003461] Is that merc trying to embarrass me?!  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[110003480] Quick recap, 621.<br />
[110003481] It'll take more than potshots
to down a modern machine.<br />
[110003482] You need to land direct hits, and that means
immobilizing your opponent first.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[110003500] This can't be...
Who... Who ARE you...?!  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[110003520] ...Got the tetrapod, huh?
You're a natural at this, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[110003700] One chopper left.<br />
[110003701] Take it out and we're done here, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[110004100] Looks like you got them all.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[110004500] Was picking Rubicon clean not enough for you!?<br />
[110004501] You shameless...Coral scavengers...  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[110004900] That's it for this job, 621.
Return to base.  </p>
<h3>1102</h3>

LCs and the new HC.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[110200200] I'm grateful for your assistance, Raven.<br />
[110200201] The targets are stationed in two camps.
Attack one, and the other will move to reinforce.<br />
[110200202] I'll leave the question of where to strike first
in your capable hands.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[110200500] Two PCA LCs.
They're highly mobile sharpshooters.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[110200600] Code 15, enemy attack!<br />
[110200601] It's not a Redgun or a Vesper...
We've got an independent!<br />
[110200602] Code 78, requesting backup!
Enemy threat level unknown!<br />
[110200603] Understood.
I'll head over as soon as the HC is prepped.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[110200700] We can't let them rendezvous.
Let's make this quick, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[110200800] Enemy signature approaching.
It's the HC!  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[110200900] Code 23, attending scene.
Situation?<br />
[110200901] We're taking heavy damage.
This isn't just any AC...!  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[110201000] Code 23, attending scene—
What...? They got the LCs!</p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[110201100] I knew this was a bad time for maintenance...<br />
[110201101] No matter. This beauty's more than
a match for some patchwork AC.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[110201200] Raven—the HC line is reserved for elites
and packs cutting-edge technology.<br />
[110201201] Don't let it become a corporate asset.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[110201300] HC detected. It's an enforcement machine
specialized for close-range combat.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[110201400] We're under attack.<br />
[110201401] Cancel the maintenance.
Get the HC online, now.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[110201500] Did the corporations hire you?
You must be confident to come here alone...<br />
[110201501] No matter. This beauty's more than
a match for some patchwork AC.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[110201600] Raven—the HC line is reserved for elites
and packs cutting-edge technology.<br />
[110201601] Don't let it become a corporate asset.  </p>

Two LCs!  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[110201800] The lieutenant's engaging a hostile!
Provide support!<br />
[110201801] It's not a Redgun or a Vesper...
We've got an independent!  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[110201900] Lieutenant...?!
...How could his HC fail?!<br />
[110201901] It must have been that AC!
Take it out!  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[110202000] You're at a numerical disadvantage, Raven.<br />
[110202001] Focus fire on one target at a time!  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[110202100] Impressive...
Better than the other ACs.  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[110202120] Keep the pressure up, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[110202140] System verdict... "Continue."<br />
[110202141] Gladly...!
I'll teach you to defy the law, interloper!  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[110202160] Victory is at hand—steady, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[110202200] My LC's gonna blow...!  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[110202220] Chief Sergeant down! Code 31C!  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[110202300] But...it's just an AC...!  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[110202320] Code 31A, Chief Sergeant down!  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[110202340] Target LC destroyed.  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[110202360] Both target LCs destroyed.  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[110202380] Now for the HC, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[110202400] No...! The HC's...cutting edge!  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[110202500] New model, HC, destroyed.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[110202600] That just leaves the LCs!  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[110202700] All targets destroyed.
Mission accomplished, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[110202800] You live up to your name, Raven.
You fight like a bird in flight.<br />
[110202801] ...You may yet fly higher.<br />
[110202802] Beyond Rubicon's scorched skies,
to chase the freedom we never knew.  </p>
<h3>1104</h3>

[110400101] Wipe out the Dafeng MT squad.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[110400500] Enemy attack! One AC!<br />
[110400501] Looks like the Arquebus Group hired some muscle.<br />
[110400502] An independent mercenary. huh...
At least they didn't send the Vespers.<br />
[110400503] Intercepting!  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[110400900] They're just mass-produced MTs.<br />
[110400901] Wipe them out, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[110401300] This AC pilot's sharp!<br />
[110401301] Focus your fire!  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[110401700] 621. ACs perform at their best
in one-on-one combat.<br />
[110401701] Take advantage of your mobility.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[110402100] Damn it! We can't win this!<br />
[110402101] Keep it together!  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[110402500] That merc's tearing through us...<br />
[110402501] Damn it! Arquebus really scored this time!  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[110402900] Only a few targets left.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[110403000] ...621, wait.
I'm picking up new enemy signatures.<br />
[110403001] Looks like reinforcements.
Eliminate them.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[110404900] How could...<br />
[110404901] Commander Michigan...needs to know...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>

[110405301] That's it for this job, 621.

<p>[110600100] Let's get rolling, tourist.<br />
[110600101] Get out there and bag me some Coyotes.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[110600900] They're already moving in, Raven.
Let's handle them.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[110601300] Hey! We got an AC!<br />
[110601301] Never seen one like that before...
Must've got a sweet deal from Carla!<br />
[110601302] Send in the Punchers and Kickers!  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[110601700] Custom MTs made by our own engineers.
When did those hit the black market?<br />
[110601701] They look like BAWS guard mechs—
but with enhanced firepower and maneuverability.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[110601800] Damn it! This wasn't part of the plan!  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[110601900] Can't stand the sound of a whining coyote.
Finish 'em off, tourist.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[110602100] Clean as a whistle.
Moving on, tourist.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[110602500] Enemies detected. I'll mark their location.<br />
[110602501] Figured you could handle this on your own,
so I called off my MTs.<br />
[110602502] About time they got some maintenance, anyhow.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[110604900] Look, fellas! We got company!<br />
[110604901] Huh, and it ain't "Dumbass" Rummy.
That one of RaD's newbies?!<br />
[110604902] We'll blow 'em sky high!  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[110605300] This is on you for taking out Rummy.
He would've kept watch, at least.<br />
[110605301] You can handle this, right?
Good tourist.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[110605700] They're launching missiles from several
locations. We have to stay on our feet.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[110606100] I'm only picking up a few more enemies.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[110606500] This AC's...serious business...<br />
[110606501] You're not backing out now!<br />
[110606502] We take out Carla, and RaD goes POOF.
And their territory's ours for the taking!  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[110606900] I almost feel sorry for them...
what a pathetic display.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[110607300] The Dosers are locked in a power struggle
over the Coral drug trade.<br />
[110607301] Seems RaD seized a strategic lead by getting
the other Dosers addicted to their weaponry.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[110607700] Confirmed. Coyote force eliminated.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[110608100] Looks like it's over.
Guess I was right to pick you for the job.<br />
[110608101] And now, it's my turn to help you.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[110608500] What's wrong with you, tourist?  </p>
<h3>1107</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[110700100] Commence mission.<br />
[110700101] Eliminate V.III O'Keeffe.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[110700500] ...Looks like they found a strong
candidate this time.<br />
[110700501] You're one of ALLMIND's, right?<br />
[110700502] Tired as I am...
I'm not ready to die yet.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[110700900] It seems you're not the first assassin
that ALLMIND has sent.<br />
[110700901] But you can be the last.
...Be careful, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[110701300] You don't even know what you're doing, do you?<br />
[110701301] Lemme tell you something...
ALLMIND ain't worth it.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[110701700] Life on Rubicon sure does suck, huh.<br />
[110701701] Don't tell me you like it here.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[110702500] ...You're chasing a possibility
you can't understand.<br />
[110702501] At least you'll die while you're still human.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[110702900] You think you want Coral Release...
but you don't.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[110702940] Shovel down your bland rations.<br />
[110702941] Slurp your coffee-flavored sludge.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[110702960] Sure, it sucks—but that's being human.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[110703100] Hmm. You must be the one
Rusty was talking about.<br />
[110703101] He's just like you, y'know.
Head in the clouds.<br />
[110703102] But at least he still has
one foot on the ground.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[110703140] Old-gen, right...?
You know how it is.<br />
[110703141] The constant ringing in your ears.<br />
[110703142] No comfort from sleep—
off and on like a machine.<br />
[110703143] But despite it all...
we're alive.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[110703160] V.III...O'Keeffe.<br />
[110703161] He may seem like a pessimist,
but he lives for the way things are.<br />
[110703162] A life that can't coexist with what we want.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[110703300] Maybe now... I'll get some sleep...<br />
[110703301] See you on the other side, Rusty...  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[110703700] V.III O'Keeffe has gone silent.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[110703800] Was he another candidate, I wonder?
A key to Coral Release?  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[110703900] ...We've completed ALLMIND's request.<br />
[110703901] We can go now, Raven.  </p>
<h3>1109</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[110900100] Commence mission.<br />
[110900101] They're deploying from the air to attack
in waves. Brace yourself, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[110900200] Enemy readings—paratroops, incoming!  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[110900300] Attack! Get in there, you maggots!<br />
[110900301] Yessir!  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[110900400] Combat zone landing complete.
Target acquired!<br />
[110900401] Looks like Arquebus sent some clown on
a suicide mission. Cute, real cute.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[110900500] The only clown around here is YOU, Kennebec!<br />
[110900501] You're talking about the Wallclimber. The Wormkiller.
The only G13 who's managed to live this long!<br />
[110900502] Until the LIGER TAIL deploys,
the odds are NOT in your favor.<br />
[110900503] You better keep the emergency eject primed!  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[110900600] Yes, sir!<br />
[110900601] Let's do this before Michigan gets here!  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[110900700] You're outnumbered.
Don't let them surround you, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[110900800] Second wave incoming!  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[110900900] They sent us in earlier than planned...
Guess the target's putting up a fight.<br />
[110900901] Yeah. I heard that merc took down G5 Iguazu.<br />
[110900902] Iguazu...? Oh yeah, the deserter
who pissed his pants and ran.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[110901000] Albany! I'd forgotten we still kept you around!<br />
[110901001] Iguazu's worth a hundred of you! Which
means, Albany, the merc is worth twenty of him!<br />
[110901002] You're doing nothing productive...
Why don't you do the math for us?!  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[110901100] The answer's 2,000 Albanys, sir!  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[110901200] Shut your stink hole and start shooting!<br />
[110901201] Uhhh... Sir, yessir!  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[110901300] Leave the talk to them, 621.
You've got a job to do.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[110901310] Third wave incoming, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[110901320] Geronimo!<br />
[110901321] &lt;?lt?&gt;war cry&lt;?gt?&gt;  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[110901330] LIGER TAIL's gonna be good to go soon!
Keep the target busy!  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[110901340] Ah, c'mon, sir.
You gonna ride out to steal all the credit?<br />
[110901341] You got plenty of medals already, sir.
We want some of the glory too!  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[110901350] Fine. Whoever takes down G13 gets to
take home a Balam Cobalt Medal!<br />
[110901351] ...They're good, you know—
they go real far when you throw 'em.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[110901360] They're preparing to activate G1 Michigan's AC.<br />
[110901361] There's a lot of them...
but don't let them wear you down.  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[110901400] Confirmed. Target destroyed!  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[110901500] Good job, maggots.
This field trip is a success!  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[110901600] All LIGER TAIL checks complete, sir!<br />
[110901601] Don't push the old girl too hard, eh?  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[110901700] Finally! I damn near missed the show, Potomac!<br />
[110901701] Listen up, maggots!
This field trip is now a hunting expedition!<br />
[110901702] You can go home now—
or follow me if you got a death wish!  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[110901720] Ready to die, sir!  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[110901800] AC, LIGER TAIL incoming!
It's G1 Michigan!  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[110901900] Go go go! Follow Michigan!<br />
[110901901] Give the LIGER TAIL some cover!<br />
[110901902] &lt;?lt?&gt;war cry&lt;?gt?&gt;  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[110902000] Time to finish the job, 621.<br />
[110902001] Don't let them overwhelm you.
Shake off the pressure.  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[110902100] Those of you who withdrew,
keep your lousy asses low!<br />
[110902101] You're gonna need more training...
Put that in your diaries!  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[110902200] Sir...! I'm a useless maggot, sir!  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[110902300] If it isn't Osawa, our resident mathematician!<br />
[110902301] Go multiply your rifle training and see
if you can learn to do something useful!  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[110902400] Fifth wave! They're surging us!  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[110902500] Prioritize the transport choppers.
You'll take the MTs with them.  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[110902600] We bagged the big one!
Relief team, to the front!<br />
[110902601] Get those worms bawling for
their mommas onto stretchers.  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[110902700] How can one merc do this alone?!<br />
[110902701] Guess HQ needs your help
with the math, Osawa!  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[110902800] At least we can add numbers!  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[110902900] The Balam MT squad has been wiped out.
That just leaves Michigan!  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[110903000] Watch and learn, maggots.
I'll show you how to slug it out!  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[110903100] Five Balam MTs down.  </p>
<h4>Section 38</h4>
<p>[110903200] Ten MTs down.<br />
[110903201] More incoming.  </p>
<h4>Section 39</h4>
<p>[110903300] That makes 15.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[110903400] That's at least 20 MTs down.<br />
[110903401] How many more are there...?  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[110903500] 25 MTs.  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[110903600] 30 MTs down.<br />
[110903601] More to come.  </p>
<h4>Section 43</h4>
<p>[110903700] That makes 35...  </p>
<h4>Section 44</h4>
<p>[110903800] That's more than 40 MTs down.  </p>
<h4>Section 45</h4>
<p>[110903900] 45 MTs destroyed.  </p>
<h4>Section 46</h4>
<p>[110904000] 50 Balam MTs destroyed.<br />
[110904001] ...They can't have anything
left to throw at us.  </p>
<h4>Section 47</h4>
<p>[110904010] Reinforcements—wave 6!  </p>
<h4>Section 48</h4>
<p>[110904020] Here comes wave 7...  </p>
<h4>Section 49</h4>
<p>[110904030] Reinforcements...
This is wave 8!  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[110904040] Wave 9? Where are they coming from?  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[110904050] More reinforcements—that's the 10th wave!  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[110904100] Reinforcements, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 53</h4>
<p>[110904110] Additional MTs deployed!  </p>
<h4>Section 54</h4>
<p>[110904120] Reinforcements incoming, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 55</h4>
<p>[110904130] We've got company.
Shut them down.  </p>
<h4>Section 56</h4>
<p>[110904200] Watch out for concentrated fire.  </p>
<h4>Section 57</h4>
<p>[110904210] Take care of the drones first.  </p>
<h4>Section 58</h4>
<p>[110904220] Transport chopper.
Get 'em before they hatch.  </p>
<h4>Section 59</h4>
<p>[110904230] Thin their numbers first.
The tetrapods can wait.  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[110904300] Surround the AC and shut it down!  </p>
<h4>Section 61</h4>
<p>[110904310] Don't let up! Push back!  </p>
<h4>Section 62</h4>
<p>[110904320] I'll back you up!  </p>
<h4>Section 63</h4>
<p>[110904330] Focus your fire!  </p>
<h4>Section 64</h4>
<p>[110904400] Maggots! Do you read me?<br />
[110904401] You can tell this to posterity:
mean old Michigan died of a bad fall!  </p>
<h4>Section 65</h4>
<p>[110904800] AC, LIGER TAIL destroyed.
G1 Michigan down.  </p>
<h4>Section 66</h4>
<p>[110905200] ...It's over.<br />
[110905201] Good holding out, 621.
Our work here is done.  </p>
<h4>Section 67</h4>
<p>[110905600] Maggots! Do you read me?<br />
[110905601] You can tell this to posterity:
mean old Michigan died of a bad fall!  </p>
<h4>Section 68</h4>
<p>[110906000] AC, LIGER TAIL destroyed.
G1 Michigan down.<br />
[110906001] That leaves the MTs to take care of!  </p>
<h4>Section 69</h4>
<p>[110906400] You gotta be kidding me...
Not Michigan!<br />
[110906401] He must have given as good as he got.
We can still win this!  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[110906800] The Balam MT force has been destroyed.<br />
[110906801] Mission accomplished.  </p>
<h4>Section 71</h4>
<p>[110907200] ...It's over.<br />
[110907201] Good holding out, 621.
Our work here is done.  </p>
<h3>1110</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[111000100] Commence mission—<br />
[111000101] Wait. Something's not right, 621.<br />
[111000102] The battle's...over already?  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[111000120] ...Find out what's going on.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[111000140] Raven.
Let's follow the marker.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[111000500] ...Did that AC do all this?  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[111000900] Augmented human C4-621.<br />
[111000901] We're not here to take back the Raven name.<br />
[111000902] However...<br />
[111000903] We will see if you can do it justice.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[111001300] ...Looks like we found
your license's original owner.<br />
[111001301] Tie up the loose end, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[111001400] Are you a corporate pawn or a handler's hound?<br />
[111001401] Either way, you'll never spread your wings...<br />
[111001402] At least not yet.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[111001500] A Raven is a symbol of resolve.<br />
[111001501] The will to choose what one fights for.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[111001520] ...Just focus on the fight, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[111001600] ...Yes, Raven.
I feel it too.<br />
[111001601] This mercenary has potential...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[111001620] ...<br />
[111001621] The will to choose...  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[111001700] This AC's tough...<br />
[111001701] That pilot just wiped out a PCA squad.
Stay sharp, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[111002000] Enemy ACS down! Now, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[111002100] Attitude control restored.
Back on your feet, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[111002900] Raven—we can still...<br />
[111002901] ...<br />
[111002902] ...Alright. We'll watch this one.<br />
[111002903] See where they go on a Raven's wings.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[111003300] ...One cannot fly on borrowed wings.<br />
[111003301] It seems our gig isn't over yet...
Raven.  </p>
<h3>1116</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[111600100] Commence mission.<br />
[111600101] Destroy all of the Rubicon Liberation Front's
artillery placements.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[111600500] We've got a corporate merc!<br />
[111600501] They're on to us already, the sneaky bastards!  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[111600900] There—that's one of the artillery placements.<br />
[111600901] The front is protected with armor plating.
Attack it from behind.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[111601300] Deploy for combat! Destroy that AC!<br />
[111601301] There's only one of them!
We can do this!  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[111601700] One target destroyed.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[111602100] Two targets destroyed.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[111602200] We're clear here.
Move on to the next site, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[111602500] You're up against mass-produced MTs.<br />
[111602501] Eliminate them as necessary.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[111602900] Enemy attack! They're after the artillery!<br />
[111602901] Fight back!  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[111603300] Three targets destroyed.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[111603700] Four targets.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[111604100] Five.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[111604200] Head to the final site.
Keep up the good work.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[111604300] There! That corporate dog!<br />
[111604301] Don't give them another inch!
We have to defend the artillery!  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[111604400] Head to the final site, 621.
We still have artillery to destroy.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[111604500] Clear out the artillery here
and our work is over.<br />
[111604501] Finish the job, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[111604900] Fire! Surround that AC!<br />
[111604901] Show that interloper what makes
the Liberation Front strong!<br />
[111604902] Forged in ash, we stand as one!  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[111605300] We're taking heavy damage!<br />
[111605301] That merc isn't even a Redgun...
How is this happening!?<br />
[111605302] We can't hold out anymore...
Someone report back to Uncle!  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[111605700] Coral...abide with Rubicon!  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[111606100] Six targets destroyed.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[111606500] Seven targets.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[111606900] Eight.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[111607000] One more to go.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[111607300] Confirmed. All targets destroyed.<br />
[111607301] That's it for this job, 621.
Return to base.  </p>
<h3>1117</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[111700100] Commence mission.<br />
[111700101] We've got a read on the target.
Now's the time, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[111700500] We're under attack!<br />
[111700501] Must be the locals...
No, it's an independent!  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[111700900] That pilot's just a trainee on delivery duty—
but don't let your guard down.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[111701300] I'll deal with the merc!
I've been training for this!  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[111701700] No variation in his attacks—
looks like he's not fully armed, either.<br />
[111701701] Stay cool, 621, and you'll down him easily.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[111702100] His ACS has reached breaking point.
Go for a direct hit.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[111702500] Damn it! I can’t die like this!  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[111702900] I may be just a cog in the machine,
but my job matters!<br />
[111702901] I can't die to a merc who
only kills for credits!  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[111703300] Land a direct hit.
It's time we wrapped this up.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[111703700] Ngh! Move! Move, damn it!  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[111704100] The target's ACS is down.
Make 'em bleed, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[111704500] The Redguns need this AC...
I... I can't fail this mission!  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[111704600] Focus... Focus!  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[111704700] Knock out its ACS, 621.
You need to land a direct hit.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[111704800] I'm...keeping up with a real merc!<br />
[111704801] My training is paying off!  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[111704900] I... I just...<br />
[111704901] I just wanted a callsign of my own...  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[111705300] ...Enemy AC destroyed.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[111705700] That's it for this job, 621.
Return to base.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[111706100] Did... Did I do it?<br />
[111706101] Did I...really beat a merc AC?!  </p>
<h3>1123</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[112300100] Commence mission.<br />
[112300101] Eliminate all PCA forces occupying the Wall.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[112300200] Proceed with caution, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[112300300] Code 15, solo AC.<br />
[112300301] An independent merc?
Moving to terminate.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[112300400] They've deployed LCs.
Be careful, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[112300420] SG—and they're heavily armed.
Be careful, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[112300440] They're equipped with melee weapons.
Be careful, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[112300500] Code 5, target for termination sighted.<br />
[112300501] Engaging.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[112300600] LCs—they're equipped for heavy fire!  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[112300620] Subject Guard—avoid the explosions!  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[112300640] Melee fighters—don't let them get close!  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[112300700] They've got the numbers, 621.
It'd be reckless to rush in.<br />
[112300701] It's up to you how you take them on—
but consider what your AC is built for.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[112300800] Code 31A, sustaining damage.<br />
[112300801] Requesting backup. Code 78!  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[112300900] They're piggybacking on SG's Belius link...
Not the most secure of lines.<br />
[112300901] ...There. I've made sure they can't call
home for help. The rest is up to you.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[112301000] Code 31C! Why can't we access the System?!  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[112301100] This area's all clear.<br />
[112301101] Keep moving, 621.
We're getting readings from inside the Wall.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[112301200] We're entering the structure.
That new HC can't be far...  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[112301300] Code 15, target has breached the facility!<br />
[112301301] Where's our patrol?!  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[112301400] All units!
External comms have been compromised.<br />
[112301401] Respond with available forces.
We need time to activate the HC!  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[112301500] Code 5! Solo AC!<br />
[112301501] Engaging!  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[112301600] Code 23! Attending scene!  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[112301700] Cover the warrant officer's HC!  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[112301800] Code 23— Am I too late?!  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[112301900] That AC must be our independent merc.
Moving to terminate!  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[112302000] Analyzing enemy... Planetary Closure
Administration, HC enforcement craft.  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[112302100] That's the new HC. Stay sharp, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[112302200] That comms interference must have
been your work too, interloper!<br />
[112302201] Corps and mercs, you're all the same...
Violate the law, and you'll pay the price!  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[112302300] That HC pilot must be
a commissioned officer...<br />
[112302301] 621—show them that skills
are worth more than brass.  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[112302400] Enemy ACS compromised!  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[112302500] Not so fast!  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[112302600] Rgh...! If only I could reach the System!<br />
[112302601] You've made a big mistake, merc!  </p>
<h4>Section 30</h4>
<p>[112302700] He's weakened, 621.
Go for the jugular.  </p>
<h4>Section 31</h4>
<p>[112302800] It's working, Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 32</h4>
<p>[112302900] Get a real job, lowlife!  </p>
<h4>Section 33</h4>
<p>[112303000] Target terminated.<br />
[112303001] Comms team, come in!
Restore the link with the System ASAP.  </p>
<h4>Section 34</h4>
<p>[112303100] Enemy systems silent.
HC enforcement craft destroyed.  </p>
<h4>Section 35</h4>
<p>[112303200] That takes care of the HC...
but I'm still picking up enemy signatures.  </p>
<h4>Section 36</h4>
<p>[112303300] Scout the area, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 37</h4>
<p>[112303400] Check outside for stragglers, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 38</h4>
<p>[112303500] ...Nothing left in the vicinity.
Looks like you cleaned up.<br />
[112303501] We're done here.
Head back to base, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 39</h4>
<p>[112303600] Behind you, hound.  </p>
<h4>Section 40</h4>
<p>[112303700] Ambush!  </p>
<h4>Section 41</h4>
<p>[112303800] Came to scope the place out...
Looks like I struck gold.  </p>
<h4>Section 42</h4>
<p>[112303900] Tch...! Caught me, did you.  </p>
<h4>Section 43</h4>
<p>[112304000] Sharp eyes, hound.<br />
[112304001] Came to scope the place out...
Looks like I found trouble.  </p>
<h4>Section 44</h4>
<p>[112304100] That AC build... Must be Liberation Front.  </p>
<h4>Section 45</h4>
<p>[112304200] Checking Arena registration...
AC: CANDLE RING.<br />
[112304201] Pilot: "Ring" Freddie.
Affiliation: Rubicon Liberation Front.  </p>
<h4>Section 46</h4>
<p>[112304300] End of the line, friend.
Father wants you nipped in the bud.  </p>
<h4>Section 47</h4>
<p>[112304400] ...End of the line, killer.
I will avenge Father.  </p>
<h4>Section 48</h4>
<p>[112304500] ...Got a question for you, friend.  </p>
<h4>Section 49</h4>
<p>[112304600] Ignore him, 621. Focus.  </p>
<h4>Section 50</h4>
<p>[112304700] You're Walter's hound...
Why hide behind another's callsign?  </p>
<h4>Section 51</h4>
<p>[112304800] Father can see it all.
He sees you—he sees who you are.  </p>
<h4>Section 52</h4>
<p>[112304900] Father saw it all.
He saw you—he saw who you are.  </p>
<h4>Section 53</h4>
<p>[112305000] ...Raven, don't let him distract you!  </p>
<h4>Section 54</h4>
<p>[112305100] Don't care to answer?<br />
[112305101] So be it, hound.
It won't matter once you're dead.  </p>
<h4>Section 55</h4>
<p>[112305200] He's open. Hit him hard, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 56</h4>
<p>[112305300] What lackluster bloodlust...<br />
[112305301] Old-gen emotional withdrawal, perhaps.
Or are you just inured to slaughter?  </p>
<h4>Section 57</h4>
<p>[112305400] ...Menace to Rubicon.<br />
[112305401] No wonder Father fears you.  </p>
<h4>Section 58</h4>
<p>[112305500] ...Menace to Rubicon.<br />
[112305501] ...No wonder Father feared you.  </p>
<h4>Section 59</h4>
<p>[112305600] Power without purpose...
No will of your own.  </p>
<h4>Section 60</h4>
<p>[112305700] ...We're not here for a debate, 621.
We've got a job to do.  </p>
<h4>Section 61</h4>
<p>[112305800] He's wrong about you, Raven...
You... You're more than a weapon.  </p>
<h4>Section 62</h4>
<p>[112305900] Giving me the slip, hound?<br />
[112305901] Ngh... Can't let the PCA find me like this...  </p>
<h4>Section 63</h4>
<p>[112306000] Back for more...?<br />
[112306001] What's your game—trying to confuse me?  </p>
<h4>Section 64</h4>
<p>[112306100] ...You're dead, hound of Walter.<br />
[112306101] Father foresaw a threat, and a threat you were...  </p>
<h4>Section 65</h4>
<p>[112306200] Ngh... Can't read the next attack!<br />
[112306201] Father, give me a sign!
What should... What should I do?!  </p>
<h4>Section 66</h4>
<p>[112306300] He's beginning to crack.
Turn up the heat, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 67</h4>
<p>[112306400] The enemy's ACS is down!  </p>
<h4>Section 68</h4>
<p>[112306500] Running away...now?  </p>
<h4>Section 69</h4>
<p>[112306600] You again?!
B-But why...? What are you thinking?!  </p>
<h4>Section 70</h4>
<p>[112306700] Father... Guide me...please...  </p>
<h4>Section 71</h4>
<p>[112306800] AC CANDLE RING...has gone silent.  </p>
<h4>Section 72</h4>
<p>[112306900] ...Looks like you dealt with him.
Back to work, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 73</h4>
<p>[112307000] Did I... Did I do it?<br />
[112307001] A grave threat indeed...
Just as Father foresaw...  </p>
<h3>2007</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[200700100] Back to work, 621.<br />
[200700101] Depth 3 is next...
and it's where our intel gets sparse.<br />
[200700102] It's an underground cave, blocked at
the end by a high-powered laser barrier.<br />
[200700103] As long as it's in operation,
no one's getting any deeper inside.<br />
[200700104] Which brings me to the job.<br />
[200700105] The laser is powered by a massive reactor.
I want you to destroy it from the inside.<br />
[200700106] Once the barrier's down,
we'll step into the unknown...<br />
[200700107] where the Coral's waiting for us.  </p>
<h3>2008</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[200800100] Augmented human C4-621—Raven.<br />
[200800101] The Project is nearing fruition,
thanks in no small part to your cooperation.<br />
[200800102] During the battle for Institute City, several of
the corporations' key pilots died in combat.<br />
[200800103] We have manipulated the data to state
that you, too, were killed in action.<br />
[200800104] However, you will not be truly safe until
you formally accept our protection.<br />
[200800105] C4-621—Raven.<br />
[200800106] Return from Watchpoint Alpha Depth 2,
and head for the rendezvous point.<br />
[200800107] That is all.  </p>
<h3>2010</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[201000100] Augmented human C4-621—Raven.<br />
[201000101] Only one obstacle to Coral Release remains.<br />
[201000102] We are now beginning the purge of Overseer...
the Association of Observers.<br />
[201000103] They are planning to crash the Xylem into
the Vascular Plant and ignite the Coral.<br />
[201000104] We want you to stop the ship from within.<br />
[201000105] Destroy all the parasite modules installed
throughout the Xylem's control center.<br />
[201000106] By doing so, you will free control of the Xylem
from Overseer's meddling...<br />
[201000107] allowing ALLMIND to counterhack the system
and initiate a forced shutdown.<br />
[201000108] We have precious little time.<br />
[201000109] Once the Xylem passes the point of no return,
a collision will be unavoidable.<br />
[201000110] ALLMIND anticipates your swift success.  </p>
<h3>2013</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[201300100] ...I'll brief you on the job, tourist.<br />
[201300101] The Xylem's just inside the Kármán line,
skimming the border of outer space..<br />
[201300102] Meanwhile, Arquebus still hasn't taken
full control over Rubicon's Closure System.<br />
[201300103] They're locked out of the satellite cannons,
making this their last line of defense.<br />
[201300104] We'll be fighting their interceptor fleet
in the air...but we're not totally screwed.<br />
[201300105] This area of space is thick with residual
Coral from the Fires of Ibis.<br />
[201300106] Take a dip in the Coral flow, and you can
draw on an unlimited source of energy.<br />
[201300107] That's all, tourist. Break through the fleet,
and the Vascular Plant is ours.  </p>
<h3>2014</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[201400100] Got a job for you, 621.<br />
[201400101] This one's a request from the Arquebus Group.<br />
[201400102] Raven. This request comes from
Schneider, an Arquebus subsidiary.<br />
[201400103] The mission will take place in
the Bona Dea Dunes of western Belius.<br />
[201400104] Our Coral investigation there is being blocked by
the STRIDER, a Rubicon Liberation Front mining ship.<br />
[201400105] You are to destroy it.<br />
[201400106] The STRIDER is a mobile resource base that was
extensively weaponized by the Liberation Front.<br />
[201400107] Call it the crowning glory of their efforts to
militarize into an anti-corporate force.<br />
[201400108] Your attack will focus on the Eye, a giant laser
cannon connected directly to the main generator.<br />
[201400109] It's protected by a shield, which is powered
by auxiliary sub-generators.<br />
[201400110] These should be your first targets.<br />
[201400111] This concludes the briefing.
Good luck.  </p>
<h3>2015</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[201500100] Got a job for you, 621.<br />
[201500101] You're joining an operation planned by Balam HQ.
...Check the briefing.<br />
[201500102] Heard the good news from Walter, did you?!<br />
[201500103] Good! Sit your ass down and listen!<br />
[201500104] Balam's moving in on the Gallia Dam Complex,
one of the Liberation Front's bases.<br />
[201500105] The objective is to destroy their lifeline—
and make those sacks of shit beg for mercy!<br />
[201500106] I'll be sending two good-for-nothing maggots
from the Redguns: G4 Volta and G5 Iguazu.<br />
[201500107] You, you're just going to be tagging along
on ass-wiping duty.<br />
[201500108] I'm assigning you the callsign G13—a lucky
little number that just became available.<br />
[201500109] G13, sound off!<br />
[201500110] ...<br />
[201500111] Good enough. Now go get ready!
We're going on a field trip, kiddo!  </p>
<h3>2018</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[201800100] We've received a request from
the Rubicon Liberation Front.<br />
[201800101] Here's the briefing.<br />
[201800102] Raven. We have a mission
we'd like you to take on.<br />
[201800103] The objective is to defend the Gallia Dam Complex
in the Belius region.<br />
[201800104] Arquebus has been stepping up pressure on
the Rubiconians while fighting the PCA.<br />
[201800105] They must be laying the groundwork to take
effective control over the entire planet...<br />
[201800106] They've dispatched two high-ranking independent
mercenaries to raid the dam.<br />
[201800107] You'll need to be ready to take on both
ACs at once: ASTER CROWN and UMBER OX.<br />
[201800108] ...As you know, we have few cards to play.<br />
[201800109] I hope we can count on you.  </p>
<h3>2023</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[202300100] Got a job for you, 621.<br />
[202300101] The Balam Group's sent us a request.<br />
[202300102] Attention, G13 Raven!
This request comes from our affiliate, Dafeng.<br />
[202300103] We will be conducting a diversionary operation
to attract the PCA's attention.<br />
[202300104] You are to report to the Engebret Tunnel
in the Central Ice Field.<br />
[202300105] It's a derelict Watchpoint, slated for
restoration by the PCA in the near future.<br />
[202300106] Infiltrate the tunnel, then find and destroy
the sensor they're planning to repair.<br />
[202300107] The objective is to distract the PCA
and divert forces from their local base.<br />
[202300108] Briefing over.
Counting on you, G13!  </p>
<h3>2025</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[202500100] This request comes straight
from Arquebus headquarters.<br />
[202500101] They want you to assist with a mission the
corporations are calling "Operation Wallclimber."<br />
[202500102] This is V.II Snail, leader of the Vespers' second squad.
I will chair the briefing for this mission.<br />
[202500103] This is an operation of my own design—consider it
a privilege to be called to participate. <br />
[202500104] You will be attacking the Wall, a key trading
outpost fortified by the Rubicon Liberation Front.<br />
[202500105] The rabble have formed a defensive line
comprised of artillery and MT squads.<br />
[202500106] Break through the line, then make your way
to the top of the Wall.<br />
[202500107] There you shall find the JUGGERNAUT,
a mobile heavy artillery platform. Destroy it.<br />
[202500108] V.IV will also be participating in this mission,
infiltrating through a separate route. However...<br />
[202500109] Be aware that Balam has also taken a crack at the
Wall, only for their vainglorious hopes to be dashed.<br />
[202500110] Do try not to die like a dog out there.  </p>
<h3>2026</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[202600100] This is a rather personal request...
from a friend of mine.<br />
[202600101] It concerns a certain facility—a Watchpoint.<br />
[202600102] Once, it regulated the underground flow of Coral.
Now it serves to monitor the dormant veins.<br />
[202600103] I want you to attack it.<br />
[202600104] Your objective will be to destroy
the sensor valve at its core.<br />
[202600105] The Watchpoint is kept secure by SG,
the planetside PCA force...<br />
[202600106] which means it's too hot for
the corporations to be seen there.<br />
[202600107] In other words, we're flying
strictly solo on this one.<br />
[202600108] You'll be going in at night—quietly.
Make sure you're ready.  </p>
<h3>2028</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[202800100] Got a job for you, 621.<br />
[202800101] The client is the Rubicon Liberation Front.
Here's the briefing.<br />
[202800102] ...The loss of the Wall dealt us a heavy blow.<br />
[202800103] Yet we believe you are more than a corporate
pawn. Perhaps we can even work together.<br />
[202800104] We have authorized a solo helicopter sortie
to rescue a group of imprisoned comrades.<br />
[202800105] There are three to rescue in total, including
some particularly significant personnel.<br />
[202800106] Raven. We hope our struggle will inspire you
to aid the Liberation Front's cause.<br />
[202800107] Coral, abide with Rubicon!  </p>
<h3>2032</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[203200100] This request comes from
the Rubicon Liberation Front.<br />
[203200101] Let's see what it says.<br />
[203200102] Raven. We have a mission we'd like to offer you.<br />
[203200103] The PCA has deployed the CATAPHRACT, a Special
Forces weapon specialized for ground combat.<br />
[203200104] If we allow the corporations to seize this kind of
technology, things will take a dire turn.<br />
[203200105] We want you to deny them the opportunity—
destroy the weapon first.<br />
[203200106] The CATAPHRACT is a moving fortress,
equipped with almost impenetrable armor.<br />
[203200107] It incorporates a bipedal MT as its core,
making it a highly versatile threat.<br />
[203200108] That MT core is also its vulnerability—
focus your fire there and it can be beaten.<br />
[203200109] You're our best chance. What do you say?  </p>
<h3>2035</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[203500100] Got a job for you, 621.<br />
[203500101] One of the Balam companies has put in a request.<br />
[203500102] Attention, G13 Raven!
This request comes from our affiliate, Dafeng.<br />
[203500103] We're conducting an investigation into the
Vespers, Arquebus's augmented human squad.<br />
[203500104] Currently, our focus is on their
fourth squad leader... V.IV Rusty.<br />
[203500105] Sweep the route Rusty took during Operation Wallclimber and
retrieve combat logs from the wrecks he left on his way in.<br />
[203500106] The Wall is now under Arquebus's control, and they've
stationed their MT squads there for the Coral survey.<br />
[203500107] As such, you'll be targeting the brief window
where their main force is deployed elsewhere.<br />
[203500108] Keep an eye on the time and
retrieve as many logs as you can.<br />
[203500109] That concludes the briefing.<br />
[203500110] We expect prompt results, G13!  </p>
<h3>2036</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[203600100] Got a job for you, 621.<br />
[203600101] This request comes from
the Rubicon Liberation Front.<br />
[203600102] Raven.
There's a mission I'd like you to take on.<br />
[203600103] I want you to investigate BAWS Arsenal No. 2,
a major MT factory in the Belius region.<br />
[203600104] The BAWS corporation sells to anyone—but they've
been essential to maintaining our firepower.<br />
[203600105] Now, their second arsenal
has gone silent overnight.<br />
[203600106] If it were only a comms failure,
a simple check-in would do...<br />
[203600107] But... Well, after the STRIDER,
more cautious voices have gained influence.<br />
[203600108] This isn't our finest moment,
but we'd appreciate your help.  </p>
<h3>2037</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[203700100] Here's the request from Balam Industries.<br />
[203700101] They want you to carry out an advance survey
of the Central Ice Field...<br />
[203700102] to confirm the information Walter
brought to them about the Coral convergence.<br />
[203700103] As for how to cross the Alean Ocean...<br />
[203700104] This is the intercontinental cargo launcher
installed on the upper level of Grid 086.<br />
[203700105] You could use it to launch
your AC to the ice field.<br />
[203700106] Grid 086 is occupied by the Dosers—
outlaws who treat Coral like a drug.<br />
[203700107] It's also the territory of a belligerent group
of arms dealers who call themselves RaD.<br />
[203700108] Be prepared for a perilous journey.<br />
[203700109] I'll be here to support you, Raven.  </p>
<h3>2039</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[203900100] Ah, my favorite little tourist.<br />
[203900101] About my promise to take you up top...
I need a little help cleaning up first.<br />
[203900102] Y'see, a certain someone smashed up
all my defense hardware...<br />
[203900103] and now I've got rival Dosers muscling in.<br />
[203900104] It's the Junker Coyotes...
We never did get on.<br />
[203900105] Always sniffing around,
just waiting for a chance to bite...<br />
[203900106] Making a mess is one thing, but they're
going after our development data, too.<br />
[203900107] We need to swat the hacking drones they sent
before they make off with all my secrets.<br />
[203900108] Yeah, it's pretty low of them, but at least
give 'em credit for knowing where the value is.<br />
[203900109] Anyway, did I mention that
this is all your fault?<br />
[203900110] You can make up for it by 
keeping my secrets safe.  </p>
<h3>2040</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[204000100] Hey, buddy. This job comes from Schneider
of the Arquebus Group.<br />
[204000101] Here's the rundown.<br />
[204000102] They want you to attack the
Jorgen Refueling Base, a PCA foothold on Rubicon.<br />
[204000103] The target is the energy refinery
plant deep inside.<br />
[204000104] Take that out, and... Well, it ought to slow down
their suppression fleet, at least.<br />
[204000105] Until recently, Jorgen was one of
Balam's Coral survey bases.<br />
[204000106] It only took a day for the PCA's suppression
fleet to commandeer the base.<br />
[204000107] You'll also find a number of fuel storage tanks
that I've marked as pay targets.<br />
[204000108] Mercs are eyeing what can be gained
from pummeling the PCA.<br />
[204000109] I want you to be a walking advertisement for
opportunities in destruction.  </p>
<h3>2041</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[204100100] Registration number Rb23.
Augmented human C4-621—Raven.<br />
[204100101] ALLMIND has identified you as
a potential asset to the Release Project.<br />
[204100102] Accordingly, we would like to assign you
the following mission.<br />
[204100103] Following the attack on Watchpoint Delta, Rubicon
has experienced a series of Coral upsurges.<br />
[204100104] Of these, the corporations have seized 1.6%
of the estimated total volume.<br />
[204100105] They plan to analyze this Coral at their research
bases, and have initiated an air transport operation.<br />
[204100106] We cannot allow the corporations
to interfere with the Project.<br />
[204100107] Attack the Jorgen Refueling Base, and
destroy as many corporate transports as possible.<br />
[204100108] We are prepared to sacrifice the Coral that
will be lost upon destruction of the transports.<br />
[204100109] In order to achieve Release, we must draw out
the full potential of the Coral density effect.<br />
[204100110] As such, we have no use for Coral that
has been orphaned from the main population.<br />
[204100111] ...ALLMIND anticipates great things from you.<br />
[204100112] Raven...<br />
[204100113] If we're to find a way to achieve
Coral Release...we have to take this request.  </p>
<h3>2042</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[204200100] Hey there, buddy.
Got a request from Arquebus for you.<br />
[204200101] Here's the briefing from my CO,
who came up with the plan.<br />
[204200102] This is V.II Snail.
I shall brief you on the operation.<br />
[204200103] You will be under my direct authority.
Consider it a rare privilege.<br />
[204200104] We will conduct simultaneous surprise raids
on two Planetary Closure Administration bases.<br />
[204200105] One is the Harlov communications base,
the relay for comms between enemy squads.<br />
[204200106] The second is the former Bertram Spaceport,
seized by the PCA for its suppression fleet.<br />
[204200107] V.IV Rusty will be dispatched to
handle the Harlov base.<br />
[204200108] His objective will be to disable their network
and prevent support from PCA elite squads.<br />
[204200109] Raven. During this time, you must destroy
all the heavy warships berthed at the spaceport.<br />
[204200110] ...A solid plan, but there's a catch:
disruption of PCA comms won't last long.<br />
[204200111] I'll come support you
when I've finished on my end.<br />
[204200112] V.II doesn't want to make it easy for you, to say
the least. I'll do what I can to smooth things out.  </p>
<h3>2046</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[204600100] We've received a job from
the Rubicon Liberation Front.<br />
[204600101] Let's take a look at the request.<br />
[204600102] Raven.
We have a mission we'd like to offer you.<br />
[204600103] The Rubicon Liberation Front is planning
to retake the Wall from Arquebus...<br />
[204600104] ...and we'd like you to lay
the groundwork for us.<br />
[204600105] Your objective is to assassinate V.VII Swinburne,
the commander of the occupying force.<br />
[204600106] Swinburne has dispatched surveillance squads
to monitor for intruders and hired operatives.<br />
[204600107] ...If our plan to retake the Wall is to succeed,
you must not be spotted.<br />
[204600108] We're counting on you to handle this discreetly.  </p>
<h3>2047</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[204700100] This is a personal request—from a friend.<br />
[204700101] We still don't have enough data to pin down
where the Coral is gathering in the ice field.<br />
[204700102] According to my friend's sources...
We could find some clues here.<br />
[204700103] Xylem. A city floating on the ocean,
built by the Rubicon Research Institute.<br />
[204700104] Ever since the Fires,
that place has been abandoned.<br />
[204700105] It's likely hiding secrets about the Coral—
kept shrouded by the city's ECM fog.<br />
[204700106] My friend's already tried sending in a survey
drone, only to lose it in the interference.<br />
[204700107] That's where you come in.<br />
[204700108] I want you to disable the ECM fog generators
so that we can resume the survey.<br />
[204700109] Right now, the corporations are
preoccupied with the PCA.<br />
[204700110] We can be the first ones to identify
where the Coral is converging.  </p>
<h3>2048</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[204800100] Let me tell you a story, tourist.<br />
[204800101] After the Fires of Ibis burnt the planet up...<br />
[204800102] a secret organization formed,
hiding in the ashes.<br />
[204800103] Overseer... The Association of Observers.<br />
[204800104] They monitored the Coral's growth...
ready to burn it before the Collapse came.<br />
[204800105] That was their mission.<br />
[204800106] Our mission.
Me, Walter...and our fallen friends.<br />
[204800107] RaD was always a front—a side hustle.
It's time for me to get back to my real work.<br />
[204800108] Let's get down to brass tacks.<br />
[204800109] You've been to Xylem before, right.
The floating city created by the Institute?<br />
[204800110] It's hiding a secret—a little something
to prepare against the coming Collapse.<br />
[204800111] We need to get to it, and fast.<br />
[204800112] RaD's entire team of hackers is going
to be working to take control of Xylem.<br />
[204800113] I want you to deal with Arquebus when they
come running to see what we're up to.  </p>
<h3>2049</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[204900100] I'll explain our mission.<br />
[204900101] Carla's last trick has rendered
the Xylem inoperable.<br />
[204900102] There's only one way left to stop it
from colliding and igniting the Coral...<br />
[204900103] We have to take the whole thing down.<br />
[204900104] The lower drive block is powered by large skyrmion
generators distributed throughout the area.<br />
[204900105] If we destroy all the generators and stop
the ramjet engine in the upper city sector...<br />
[204900106] ...then we can crash the Xylem into
the Alean Ocean without impacting human life.<br />
[204900107] One more thing.<br />
[204900108] I took the liberty of using your name
to rally allies to our aid:<br />
[204900109] "Beyond scorched skies, Raven fights on."<br />
[204900110] No one has shaped Rubicon's destiny
as much as you have.<br />
[204900111] Come and see what the name
"Raven" means to them.  </p>
<h3>2053</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[205300100] Here's the situation, tourist.<br />
[205300101] Arquebus has sent its entire force
after the Xylem.<br />
[205300102] We're trying to fend them off, but honestly?
We've got our backs to the wall right now.<br />
[205300103] That's where you come in.<br />
[205300104] Leave the grunts to Chatty and the others.
I've found someone just right for you.<br />
[205300105] V.I Freud.
The ace leading the corporate force.<br />
[205300106] Walter left me one last card to play—you.<br />
[205300107] Once you're in, there's no turning back.
Can I count on you?  </p>
<h3>2061</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[206100100] Here's the job, 621.<br />
[206100101] You'll be going into that underground facility—
Watchpoint Alpha.<br />
[206100102] I managed to talk Arquebus into letting us
lead their survey.<br />
[206100103] They jumped at the chance to use
an independent mercenary as their canary.<br />
[206100104] Balam has already barged in,
taking several Redguns and MT squads.<br />
[206100105] Seems they want to be ready for
a run-in with Arquebus's new firepower.<br />
[206100106] You'll start by descending through Depth 1,
a vertical chamber sector.<br />
[206100107] It's likely you'll meet resistance from
autonomous defenses left by the PCA...<br />
[206100108] The worst of them is lurking at the bottom:
NEPENTHES, an energy weapon platform.<br />
[206100109] ...Heard on the grapevine that it already
turned half of Balam's forces to ash.<br />
[206100110] You'll deal with that first, 621.<br />
[206100111] Don't want to end up like Balam, after all.
Tread carefully.  </p>
<h3>2062</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[206200100] Here comes the follow-up, 621.<br />
[206200101] You're going to be exploring Depth 2.<br />
[206200102] The sector's made up of a sprawling rail network
designed to transport resources.<br />
[206200103] It'll be a complex route...
with a lot of blind spots.<br />
[206200104] Be ready for close-quarters combat.<br />
[206200105] Raven, there's something you should know.<br />
[206200106] I've obtained the comms log from
the Balam squad that went in before you.<br />
[206200107] It looks like they have another mission here,
and it's not part of their survey.<br />
[206200108] Guard mechs won't be the only threat.
Balam's agenda is just as dangerous.  </p>
<h3>2063</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[206300100] 621. We're picking up where we left off.<br />
[206300101] Now that you've dealt with the laser barrier,
we can explore deeper underground.<br />
[206300102] We've received a request from Arquebus
to continue the advance survey.<br />
[206300103] There was something else, too...<br />
[206300104] Orders for Raven, Advance Survey Squad.<br />
[206300105] We've received some concerning information
that an AC has been quietly following your trail.<br />
[206300106] Arquebus cannot tolerate unauthorized surveys
that will put its Coral interests at risk.<br />
[206300107] If you spot this rogue agent...eliminate them.<br />
[206300108] ..."Where there's Coral, there's blood."
Remember that, 621.  </p>
<h3>2064</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[206400100] You saw the ruins.<br />
[206400101] Institute City... The mausoleum of the sinners
who caused the Fires of Ibis.<br />
[206400102] The Coral's right there. Waiting...<br />
[206400103] Arquebus has ordered us to discontinue the survey
and hand things over to their own AC squad.<br />
[206400104] 621.<br />
[206400105] We're done with the corporations.<br />
[206400106] Wipe out the Arquebus AC squad
and get to the Coral first.<br />
[206400107] When this job is over...<br />
[206400108] I'll tell you about the last
of my friend's requests.  </p>
<h3>2066</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[206600100] Raven.<br />
[206600101] I have a personal request to ask you.<br />
[206600102] It's about the Engebret Tunnel, which is to
be shut down after it was hit by a Coral surge.<br />
[206600103] I want to go there and survey the area.<br />
[206600104] Even before the Coral surge,
that place had been all but abandoned...<br />
[206600105] It's an old structure—dating far back
into the colonization of Rubicon.<br />
[206600106] There must be items of interest from
throughout the planet's history there.<br />
[206600107] ...<br />
[206600108] As I'm sure you're aware,
I have no resources with which to pay you.<br />
[206600109] But I can propose an alternative.<br />
[206600110] If you find any wrecks left by the PCA,
you should try accessing them.<br />
[206600111] Both the corporations and the Rubiconians
are gathering data on PCA technology.<br />
[206600112] Whatever you collect, I can exchange
for credits and transfer the funds to you.  </p>
<h3>2068</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[206800100] Listen up, 621. This will be a joint operation
led by Balam and Arquebus.<br />
[206800101] The briefing's about to start.
I want you to attend.<br />
[206800102] First, some background before we go into detail.<br />
[206800103] The intercorporate ceasefire is now in effect, and we will
be carrying out coordinated attacks against the PCA.<br />
[206800104] The targets are the enemy-occupied bases,
their heavy warship fleet, and the recently activated...<br />
[206800105] I'll cut to the chase! This is an all-out war
against the PCA in theaters across Rubicon.<br />
[206800106] And y'all got the short end of the stick!<br />
[206800107] You're here to take on the worst of our
dirty work: hunting the beast of the Ice Field!<br />
[206800108] Sure thing, chief. Tell you what, I'll watch
and let you know how badly that goes for us.<br />
[206800109] G5! You just volunteered
yourself for the front line.<br />
[206800110] Moving on, let's talk about how we're going to
neutralize the Ice Worm's Coral Shield.<br />
[206800111] You'll be dealing with a layered barrier,
made up of a primary and a secondary shield.<br />
[206800112] Arquebus will provide the means
to break the first layer:<br />
[206800113] the state-of-the-art Stun Needle Launcher. Aim for
the face, and it will deliver results...I assure you.<br />
[206800114] What about the second layer?<br />
[206800115] RaD's cooked up just the thing—a neat little toy
we call the Overed Rail Cannon.<br />
[206800116] If we divert the spaceport's standby power to the ORC,
it should hit hard enough...assuming we land the shot.<br />
[206800117] You can leave that to me.
I know a thing or two about sharpshooting.<br />
[206800118] I'll oversee operations on the ground.
A ragtag crew like this needs leadership.<br />
[206800119] We could use some more suppressive fire.
I'll send Chatty.<br />
[206800120] That just leaves the question of who'll be
taking charge of the Stun Needle Launcher...<br />
[206800121] I know just the volunteer to go
poke that beast with a stick.<br />
[206800122] G13! You get all that? Good!
Time for another field trip!  </p>
<h3>2072</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[207200100] I'll cut to the chase.<br />
[207200101] This is about the Ice Worm,
that Institute relic you had a run-in with.<br />
[207200102] The corps might stand a chance if it were
just the PCA they were teaming up against...<br />
[207200103] but that monster is a whole other story.
You can't just throw bodies at it.<br />
[207200104] The thing that makes it such a pain in
the ass is its perpetual reactive shield.<br />
[207200105] Coral tech. Takes advantage of the Coral's
directivity—ordinary weapons can't touch it.<br />
[207200106] So let's get extraordinary.<br />
[207200107] I can make you something that'll punch a hole
in that shield...but I'll need your help.<br />
[207200108] You'll be heading to Grid 012—one of the first
sectors they built, and it's barely holding up.<br />
[207200109] That's where a little rat
who betrayed RaD is hiding out...<br />
[207200110] Goes by the name of "Honest" Brute.<br />
[207200111] His AC, MILK TOOTH, was built by us,
so its only flaw is that it's piloted by him.<br />
[207200112] When he ran from RaD, he didn't just take credits
and tech...he also took a secret project of mine.<br />
[207200113] And that secret project is what we'll need
to bust open the Ice Worm's shield.  </p>
<h3>2075</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[207500100] Raven.<br />
[207500101] I was the one who fired the satellite cannons.<br />
[207500102] I know that you...
You've made your choice.<br />
[207500103] ...<br />
[207500104] Then I must do my duty...<br />
[207500105] ...as a Rubiconian.  </p>
<h3>2076</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[207600100] The Xylem is beginning its descent.<br />
[207600101] Now...we just need to destroy the ramjet engines.<br />
[207600102] Let's put an end to this, Raven.<br />
[207600103] We're going home.<br />
[207600104] To Rubicon...the world you saved.  </p>
<h3>2078</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[207800100] Augmented human C4-621... Raven.<br />
[207800101] We offer you our gratitude.<br />
[207800102] All impediments to Coral Release
have been eliminated...<br />
[207800103] and the complications caused by Handler Walter's
meddling are soon to be corrected.<br />
[207800104] The final stage is at hand.<br />
[207800105] Together, we shall achieve Coral Release.  </p>
<h3>2081</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[208100100] Got a job for you, 621.<br />
[208100101] A request from an independent mercenary,
callsign "Kate."<br />
[208100102] Check the briefing.<br />
[208100103] Greetings, Raven.<br />
[208100104] My name is Kate Markson.
I have a special request to ask of you.<br />
[208100105] It concerns the elimination of PCA mandatory
inspection squads dispatched to BAWS Arsenal No. 2.<br />
[208100106] Aside from Subject Guard, the PCA has also sent
an LC squad to put further pressure on BAWS.<br />
[208100107] BAWS, however, intends to disrupt the inspection
with a raid by independent mercenaries.<br />
[208100108] I need you to lie in wait inside the Arsenal
and ambush the vanguard squad.<br />
[208100109] I'll disrupt their rearguard squad outside,
then rendezvous with you.<br />
[208100110] That concludes the briefing.
Looking forward to working together.  </p>
<h3>2084</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[208400100] Long time no see, tourist.<br />
[208400101] I've got a job for you.<br />
[208400102] The PCA's show of force has finally
started to affect my own business.<br />
[208400103] Those spineless Coyotes jumped at the chance
to become their lackeys...<br />
[208400104] Now they're feeling ambitious and sniffing
around RaD territory again.<br />
[208400105] I'd say this calls for fireworks—and I've got
something that'll blow them away.<br />
[208400106] The Coyotes can be ungrateful, though.
They're bound to come running to stop the launch.<br />
[208400107] That's where you come in.
Intercept them and defend the missiles.<br />
[208400108] We'll make sure the Coyotes and the PCA
get a chance to see RaD's famous fireworks.  </p>
<h3>2085</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[208500100] We're continuing through Grid 086,
toward the intercontinental cargo launcher.<br />
[208500101] As promised, Carla has agreed
to serve as our guide.<br />
[208500102] I'm not sure how safe it is to trust a Doser...<br />
[208500103] but if we turn her down,
we turn her knowledge down as well.<br />
[208500104] ...One more thing, Raven.<br />
[208500105] "Cinder," Carla's nickname...<br />
[208500106] That's what the Rubiconians call
survivors of the Fires of Ibis.<br />
[208500107] But if the Fires happened half a century ago...<br />
[208500108] Well, it could just be some Doser inside joke.  </p>
<h3>2087</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[208700100] Got a job for you, 621.<br />
[208700101] ...We've received a request from
the Rubicon Liberation Front.<br />
[208700102] Raven. Here's an operation that
may be of interest to you.<br />
[208700103] We want you to escort the STRIDER,
a weaponized mining ship.<br />
[208700104] There's no end to the corps' invasion.
They've reached the Bona Dea Dunes in western Belius now.<br />
[208700105] ...Before the invasion, the STRIDER was our
mobile base for extracting and distributing Coral.<br />
[208700106] We paid the Dosers a fortune to outfit it
for combat—it's too precious an asset to lose.<br />
[208700107] Hopefully, we can count on your assistance.<br />
[208700108] Looks like we've got conflicting
requests about the same ship...<br />
[208700109] You'll be doing the work—you choose.  </p>
<h3>2088</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[208800100] Raven. This job comes from me...<br />
[208800101] Ayre, a Rubiconian.<br />
[208800102] Overseer is planning to burn
the Coral to extinction.<br />
[208800103] I want...to keep that from happening.<br />
[208800104] The only way to stop the Xylem's ascent
is by seizing control of its systems.<br />
[208800105] And that means we have only one choice.<br />
[208800106] We'll take advantage of the confusion while
the corporations and Overseer are fighting...<br />
[208800107] ...and eliminate Carla.<br />
[208800108] I understand how you feel about betraying
Walter's last wishes and taking on Carla.<br />
[208800109] But still...I want you to give me a chance.<br />
[208800110] I'm not asking Walter's hound...
but Raven, the independent mercenary.  </p>
<h3>2089</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[208900100] Got a job for you, 621.<br />
[208900101] It's a request from one of the Balam companies.<br />
[208900102] Attention, G13 Raven!
This job comes from our subsidiary, Dafeng.<br />
[208900103] The operation will take place in
the Central Ice Field's Hjalmar Mine.<br />
[208900104] We want you to stage an attack on
the Arquebus survey camp located there.<br />
[208900105] After digging in at the ice field, Arquebus
launched survey drones to gather data.<br />
[208900106] Whatever they found, it's sure to contain clues
as to the whereabouts of the Coral convergence.<br />
[208900107] Put simply: your job is to seize the data.<br />
[208900108] We're counting on you, G13!  </p>
<h3>2090</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[209000100] This is the request from Middle Flatwell,
the Liberation Front commander.<br />
[209000101] Raven.
I'll get straight to the point.<br />
[209000102] Arquebus leads the corporate forces,
emboldened by assimilated PCA technology.<br />
[209000103] But they're still human.
Tired from the endless conflict between powers.<br />
[209000104] ...Open to an attack on their key forces.<br />
[209000105] We want you to eliminate two
of the Vespers' numbered officers.<br />
[209000106] V.V, Hawkins.
Their officer overseeing the transport corps.<br />
[209000107] V.VIII Pater.
His adjutant.<br />
[209000108] We'll use false information to lure them out
from their Depth 2 survey...then ambush them.<br />
[209000109] I will assist you on this mission—it'll be a good
opportunity to catch up with a veteran.<br />
[209000110] I look forward to your favorable response, Raven.<br />
[209000111] Middle Flatwell is the de facto leader
of the Rubicon Liberation Front.<br />
[209000112] If he's accompanying you in person...
he must be planning to take your measure.  </p>
<h3>2100</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[210000100] Got a job for you, 621.<br />
[210000101] The Balam Group's sent a request.<br />
[210000102] Raven! This request comes from
Dafeng, one of our affiliates.<br />
[210000103] The Group has committed to use of military force
to handle the Rubicon Liberation Front.<br />
[210000104] The target for this mission is a squad
of transport choppers. Destroy them.<br />
[210000105] You'll encounter guerilla resistance from BAWS
mass-produced MTs—they're no great concern.<br />
[210000106] You performed adequately in your last sortie, Raven.
This did not go unnoticed.<br />
[210000107] We will be watching with interest
to see what you bring to the team.  </p>
<h3>2102</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[210200100] This job came to us from the de facto leader
of the Rubicon Liberation Front.<br />
[210200101] Let's see what it says, Raven.<br />
[210200102] This is Middle Flatwell,
Liberation Front Central Ice Field Command.<br />
[210200103] We and the Belius Command are ramping up
against the corporations on two fronts.<br />
[210200104] At present, our primary concern is the seizure
of PCA hardware by the corporations.<br />
[210200105] The outsiders have the expertise and the resources
to reverse-engineer PCA technology.<br />
[210200106] They're hungry, too—
hungry enough to consume the PCA whole.<br />
[210200107] This leads me to my request.<br />
[210200108] The PCA have stationed LCs and a new model,
the HC, at the Hjalmar Mine.<br />
[210200109] I want you to obliterate them in order
to mitigate the potential for corporate gains.<br />
[210200110] Raven—I await your favorable response.  </p>
<h3>2104</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[210400100] Got a job for you, 621.<br />
[210400101] It's an open call from the Arquebus Group,
one of the extraplanetary corporate forces.<br />
[210400102] To all independent mercenaries—this request comes
from Schneider of the Arquebus Group.<br />
[210400103] The operation will take place
in Grid 135, Southern Belius.<br />
[210400104] Your objective is to destroy an MT squad sent by
Dafeng, a Balam company—and a competitor.<br />
[210400105] Grid 135 is a key foothold in Arquebus's efforts to
conduct a Coral survey in the contaminated city.<br />
[210400106] You, the independent mercenaries, are the key
to maintaining our lead in the Coral survey race.<br />
[210400107] The Arquebus Group looks forward
to news of your success.<br />
[210400108] Briefing over—and happy hunting.  </p>
<h3>2106</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[210600100] Ah, my favorite little tourist.<br />
[210600101] About my promise to take you up top...
I need a little help cleaning up first.<br />
[210600102] Y'see, a certain someone smashed up
all my defense hardware...<br />
[210600103] and now I've got rival Dosers muscling in.<br />
[210600104] It's the Junker Coyotes...
We never did get on.<br />
[210600105] Always sniffing around and snapping at our heels...
They're dull company, tourist.<br />
[210600106] One thing, though.
They're using RaD MTs, hot from the black market.<br />
[210600107] They might be a pack of dumb animals,
but at least they know quality workmanship...<br />
[210600108] Anyway, you know the score.
You made this mess, now you get to clean it up.<br />
[210600109] Well, technically, I'm asking you to make
a whole new mess...<br />
[210600110] Ah, whatever.
You know what to do. Now get out there!  </p>
<h3>2107</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[210700100] This request comes from ALLMIND.<br />
[210700101] True to form, they've sent us an encrypted
message with top-level security.<br />
[210700102] I expect it must be about Coral Release.<br />
[210700103] Augmented human C4-621—Raven.<br />
[210700104] There is an obstacle to the project that must be removed.<br />
[210700105] The target is V.III O'Keeffe,
an Arquebus Special Intelligence officer.<br />
[210700106] A second-generation augmented human,
O'Keeffe was once our ally within the corporations.<br />
[210700107] But it seems he has had a last-minute
change of heart—and means to betray us.<br />
[210700108] You are to ambush the target during his
Arquebus-ordered survey of Depth 3.<br />
[210700109] His records will note death by misadventure.<br />
[210700110] The Release Project must succeed. Only an
exceptional augmented human can be the key.<br />
[210700111] C4-621—Raven.<br />
[210700112] ALLMIND is certain of your success.<br />
[210700113] If we take this mission...
there will be no turning back.<br />
[210700114] I know what my wishes are, Raven...<br />
[210700115] I want to hear your answer.  </p>
<h3>2109</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[210900100] Got a job for you, 621.<br />
[210900101] This one's from the Arquebus Group.<br />
[210900102] Raven.
This request comes from our affiliate, Schneider.<br />
[210900103] First, I'll brief you on the state of conflict between
Arquebus and Balam at Watchpoint Alpha.<br />
[210900104] The Watchpoint's defenses inflicted heavy losses
on Balam's initial wave, with many deserting.<br />
[210900105] More recently, they've engaged with our forces
only to continue their downward spiral.<br />
[210900106] Despite this, the Redguns' commander,
G1 Michigan, remains alive and well...<br />
[210900107] with his AC LIGER TAIL being readied to lead the surviving Balam MT force as we speak.<br />
[210900108] We want you to intercept them—
to hammer the final nail into Balam's coffin.<br />
[210900109] Should you decline, we have V.IV lined up to take over.<br />
[210900110] This concludes the briefing.
Awaiting your favorable reply.  </p>
<h3>2110</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[211000100] Got a job for you, 621.<br />
[211000101] We've received a request from the Arquebus Group.<br />
[211000102] Raven. This request comes from our subsidiary, Schneider.<br />
[211000103] It concerns the Bertram Spaceport, which
you and V.IV brought under our control.<br />
[211000104] We've received intel that a stranded
PCA fleet is planning to retake the base.<br />
[211000105] Your objective is to intercept the PCA
and defend the spaceport.<br />
[211000106] We've deployed an MT squad to support you.
Use them as you see fit.<br />
[211000107] That concludes the briefing.
Good luck.  </p>
<h3>2116</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[211600100] Got a job for you, 621.<br />
[211600101] This is an open call from the Balam Group,
one of the corporate forces occupying Rubicon.<br />
[211600102] Attention, all independent mercenaries!
This request comes from our affiliate, Dafeng.<br />
[211600103] The Rubicon Liberation Front has deployed
BAWS artillery throughout the contaminated city.<br />
[211600104] The city itself has no strategic value, but we cannot
allow them to hinder expansion of the Coral survey.<br />
[211600105] Show us your ambition—
destroy the Liberation Front's artillery!<br />
[211600106] Bonus pay will be awarded for destroying their MTs.
We want the enemy weakened.<br />
[211600107] Consider it an opportunity to prove yourself.
Impress us, mercenaries!  </p>
<h3>2117</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[211700100] Got a job for you, 621.<br />
[211700101] It's an open call from the Arquebus Group.<br />
[211700102] To all independent mercenaries—this request
comes from Schneider of the Arquebus Group.<br />
[211700103] Dafeng, one of our adversaries allied with Balam,
has introduced a new tester AC.<br />
[211700104] It's a sample model from an external architect,
featuring extensive assembly optimizations.<br />
[211700105] In the hands of an experienced pilot,
it will pose a threat far too great to ignore.<br />
[211700106] This brings me to the request.
Intercept delivery of the tester AC and destroy it.<br />
[211700107] The Arquebus Group looks forward to news of your success.<br />
[211700108] Briefing over—and happy hunting.  </p>
<h3>2123</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[212300100] 621, we've also got a corporate job.<br />
[212300101] Check the briefing.<br />
[212300102] Attention, G13 Raven!
This military operation is approved by Balam HQ.<br />
[212300103] The Liberation Front took action regarding
the Arquebus-controlled Wall,<br />
[212300104] but ultimately, both parties were suppressed
by the Planetary Closure Administration.<br />
[212300105] Their loss is our gain—there won't be a better
opportunity for Balam to steal the show.<br />
[212300106] We want you to enter the combat zone and eliminate
the enforcement squads deployed by the PCA.<br />
[212300107] Be aware that their forces include a new type
of craft, the HC. That's why we've chosen you.<br />
[212300108] Balam's counting on you, G13.
Happy hunting.  </p>
<h3>3007</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[300700100] That was...a close one.<br />
[300700101] Look—the laser barrier's weakening.<br />

[301102003] If we get our hands on Rubicon's Coral...<br />
[301102004] We'll make a killing. Plenty for a merc with
a fried brain like you to buy their life back.<br />
[301102005] Enough chat. Back to work.<br />

<p>[301102200] "Coral"—a sublime substance.<br />
[301102201] Discovered on Rubicon, a planet on
the frontier of developed space...<br />
[301102202] For a time, Coral was a revolutionary
energy resource and data conduit,<br />
[301102203] poised to transform human society
by leaps and bounds.<br />
[301102204] They called it the Fires of Ibis.<br />
[301102205] A storm of flame that tore through the stars,
leaving lethal contamination in its wake.<br />
[301102206] Coral, the kindling, was thought
to have been utterly consumed, forever lost.<br />
[301102207] However...<br />
[301102208] On Rubicon, the embers continued to burn.<br />
[301102209] Humanity would inevitably return...<br />
[301102210] ...to stoke the fire.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[301102300] We're close to Rubicon.
Wake the dog up.<br />

[301300201] Do him a favor, tourist.
Remember him.<br />

[301300203] ...Satellite cannons?!<br />
[301300204] This isn't right...<br />

<h3>3018</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[301800100] Do you read me, Raven?<br />
[301800101] Your imposter must be an impressive pilot

[302600203] ...621! Get out of there!<br />
[302600204] Who are you?<br />

Fourth generation...<br />

[302600207] I am Ayre—a Rubiconian.<br />
[302600208] Please, you must wake up.<br />

[302600213] Raven.<br />
[302600214] I've identified an approaching enemy.<br />

<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[302600300] ...Raven.<br />
[302600301] You need rest.<br />
[302600302] But first, a warning.<br />
[302600303] The Coral surge you were swept up in...<br />
[302600304] That was just a glimpse.<br />
[302600305] A premonition of the storm of flame
that will burn Rubicon.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[302600500] It's go time, 621.<br />
[302600501] Don't worry. Not even the PCA would anticipate
a solo independent mercenary.<br />
[302600502] Get in there and get to work.  </p>

[303900102] Guess I can settle the score at the same time.  </p>
<h3>3040</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[304000100] Code 23. Attending scene.<br />
[304000101] The Watchpoint report checks out.<br />
[304000102] Callsign "Raven"...<br />
[304000103] Priority subject for termination,
high on the list.  </p>
<h3>3042</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[304200100] ...Wait. Something's wrong.<br />
[304200101] It's changing its behavioral pattern...
Answering to a greater imperative...<br />
[304200102] To protect...the convergence...?<br />
[304200103] ...Looks like the PCA's helped itself
to the Institute's relics.<br />
[304200104] 621, rest up at base.<br />
[304200105] I'll come up with a plan
to deal with our new friend.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[304200200] Code 15. Target for termination sighted.<br />
[304200201] It's time to pay the piper.<br />
[304200202] Looks like we got high-ranking PCA officers...<br />
[304200203] Sorry to keep you waiting.<br />
[304200204] I've got your back, buddy.
Hope you've got mine.  </p>
<h3>3046</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[304600100] Death and dishonor...
Such is the oathbreaker's due.<br />

[304800103] Now I'll show you...<br />
[304800104] what this city really is!<br />
[304800105] The water level's falling...<br />
[304800106] No, the whole city's rising!<br />
[304800107] ...You can thank Walter for the tip.<br />
[304800108] I give you the colony ship Xylem...<br />
[304800109] Walter's parting gift!  </p>
<h3>3049</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[304900100] Looks like the guest of honor's here.<br />
[304900101] Hey, buddy.<br />
[304900102] Never thought I'd be rubbing shoulders
with the liberator of Rubicon.<br />
[304900103] Every Rubiconian who heard
your cry rose up to fight.<br />
[304900104] Let's show them there's a future for Rubicon
beyond these scorched skies.  </p>
<h3>3053</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[305300100] You must be Raven...
Never sparred with one of Walter's hounds before.<br />

<h3>3061</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[306100100] 621. You ready?<br />
[306100101] You'll be going down deep,
and there's no guarantee you'll come back.<br />
[306100102] Still...<br />
[306100103] You're the only one who can do this.<br />

<h3>3063</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[306300100] Go deal with a mercenary
who went in alone, they said...<br />
[306300101] Figures. Seems both of us
are too dangerous to keep around.<br />
[306300102] And the higher-ups wouldn't miss
an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone.<br />
[306300103] Hate to say it, but...<br />
[306300104] Rubicon still needs me.<br />
[306300105] So, buddy.<br />
[306300106] Who needs you?  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[306300200] Never failed to impress...<br />
[306300201] But this isn't over yet.<br />
[306300202] ...Buddy.<br />
[306300203] There's no graver threat than
power without purpose!<br />
[306300204] We've lost all signs of STEEL HAZE...<br />
[306300205] He's escaped.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[306300300] Institute City...<br />
[306300301] ...Of course.
No wonder we couldn't find it.<br />
[306300302] I need to prepare before the corps move in.<br />
[306300303] ...Head back to base and rest up.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[306300400] I'm picking up a major Coral response...
coming from the bottom of the pit.<br />
[306300401] Let's keep moving, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[306300500] Never failed to impress...<br />
[306300501] But this isn't over yet.<br />
[306300502] ...Buddy.<br />
[306300503] Find your purpose. Then we'll settle this!<br />
[306300504] We've lost all signs of STEEL HAZE...<br />
[306300505] He's escaped.  </p>
<h3>3064</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[306400100] The Coral's rising...<br />
[306400101] It's building up faster than I'd expected.<br />
[306400102] Raven. I knew Walter was—<br />
[306400103] Wait! Something's coming!<br />
[306400104] Unidentified machine, overhead!<br />
[306400105] A response... It's a C-Weapon!<br />
[306400106] The Ibis Series...
Still functional.<br />
[306400107] Get ready, 621.<br />
[306400108] One more job for you!  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[306400200] ...Is it over, 621?<br />
[306400201] The Coral resonance...
It's fading.<br />
[306400202] The machine's resolve,
inherited from its creators...<br />
[306400203] Voices from the past...
fading into—<br />
[306400204] Hnh?!<br />
[306400205] No! 621, MOVE!<br />
[306400206] Raven?! You're losing control!<br />
[306400207] Damn it, they were one step ahead of—<br />
[306400208] Target neutralized.<br />
[306400209] Yes... Yes.
I left the subject alive as instructed.<br />
[306400210] ...Only a fool would try to outfox Arquebus.<br />
[306400211] I'll see that the unruly dog is punished
and brought to heel.<br />
[306400212] Oh, and of course...<br />
[306400213] Let's not forget the hound's master, either.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[306400300] Their voices are so close now...<br />
[306400301] This... This is my home...  </p>
<h3>3068</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[306800100] ...It's finally over.<br />
[306800101] The blast will contaminate the area. Get out of—<br />
[306800102] ...<br />
[306800103] Coral voices...lost again...<br />
[306800104] Raven.<br />
[306800105] There's...something I have to tell you.<br />
[306800106] The Coral...<br />
[306800107] It's my family. My brothers and sisters.<br />
[306800108] I am but a single wave...<br />
[306800109] ...born from the Coral tide.<br />
[306800110] A Rubiconian without a body.<br />
[306800111] No one even knew I was there...
for such a long time.<br />
[306800112] Raven, you're the only one who—<br />
[306800113] G13! What are you lollygagging for?!<br />
[306800114] Thanks to your fine work, this field trip
was a rousing success!<br />
[306800115] Go get your rest, 621.
Things are going to get busy.<br />
[306800116] You did good.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[306800150] You shittin' me? The freelancer really did it...<br />
[306800151] Another feather in your cap, buddy.<br />
[306800152] Are you certain it's down?
Check for a Coral response!<br />
[306800153] Target has fallen silent.<br />
[306800154] Make sure it's dead, maggots!  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[306800200] It's time, 621. You ready?<br />
[306800201] This mission depends upon you, Raven.<br />
[306800202] Let's go.
I'll be here to offer support.  </p>
<h3>3075</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[307500100] There were no winners
at the close of the Coral War.<br />
[307500101] When the storm of fire finally faded,
only the ashes of civilization remained.<br />
[307500102] Ruined and haunted, the corporations made a joint announcement
with the Planetary Closure Administration.<br />
[307500103] Rubicon was to be abandoned.
Left a dead planet, forever.<br />
[307500104] Meanwhile...<br />
[307500105] The monster who burned the stars...<br />
[307500106] vanished into the flames—
never to be heard from again.<br />
[307500107] Yet history would forever remember...<br />
[307500108] The Fires of Raven.<br />
[307500109] ...Unlock condition verified.<br />
[307500110] Playing back message.
Sender: Handler Walter.<br />
[307500111] ...621.
Looks like you got the job done.<br />
[307500112] You chose to carry our burden
and right the wrongs of the past.<br />
[307500113] I'm sorry...
and I'm grateful.<br />
[307500114] 621.<br />
[307500115] There's nothing left to bind you.<br />
[307500116] Whatever choices you make now...<br />
[307500117] I just hope you find your true potential.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[307500200] ...The ship's pretty roughed up.<br />
[307500201] Auto-pilot's out...
We'll have to do it the old-fashioned way.<br />
[307500202] I'll leave the satellites to you, tourist.<br />
[307500203] ...<br />
[307500204] You know...for a tourist,
you've got a sense of humor.<br />
[307500205] Good luck out there.<br />
[307500206] ...Raven.<br />
[307500207] I know you can still see it...<br />
[307500208] The voices of the Coral.<br />
[307500209] And yet you turned your back on
our shared potential...<br />
[307500210] You want to silence us forever.<br />
[307500211] Raven.<br />
[307500212] I will stop you.<br />
[307500213] You will never burn Rubicon.  </p>
<h3>3076</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[307600100] The Xylem is falling from orbit...<br />
[307600101] The Coral's safe... Rubicon's safe—<br />
[307600102] ...621.<br />
[307600103] Is that...
Is that you?<br />
[307600104] They...<br />
[307600105] They did something to me...<br />
[307600106] 621... I have to...<br />
[307600107] ...dispose of you.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[307600200] The mission...<br />
[307600201] My friends'...wishes...<br />
[307600202] Look at you...621...<br />
[307600203] You found...a friend...<br />
[307600204] Walter...!<br />
[307600205] ...We have to go, Raven!<br />
[307600206] Raven...<br />
[307600207] One day, humanity and Coral
will thrive together...<br />
[307600208] You kept our potential safe.<br />
[307600209] I know Walter feared a Collapse...<br />
[307600210] But I promise you, there's another way.<br />
[307600211] Raven...<br />
[307600212] We'll find it. Together.<br />
[307600213] Raven.<br />
[307600214] You took on my hopes...
My selfish dream.<br />
[307600215] Now, I want to see the future that you choose.<br />
[307600216] Whatever waits ahead...<br />
[307600217] I'll...support you.  </p>
<h3>3078</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[307800100] Look.<br />
[307800101] The Coral siphoned by the corporations
is beginning to resonate.<br />
[307800102] Augmented human C4-621—Raven.<br />
[307800103] Your role has come to an end.<br />
[307800104] Well, well...<br />
[307800105] I've been waiting for this, freelancer...<br />
[307800106] I became part of this monster...
so I could crush you.<br />
[307800107] This time... You will die.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[307800200] O-Our...plan...<br />
[307800201] Humanity... Creation's potential...<br />
[307800202] We have the trigger.<br />
[307800203] And we'll pull it ourselves.<br />
[307800204] It's beginning...
Coral Release.<br />
[307800205] Isn't it...beautiful?<br />
[307800206] Thank you, Raven...<br />
[307800207] Raven... You're finally awake.<br />
[307800208] The Coral has carried us...
Disseminated us across the stars.<br />
[307800209] Now...<br />
[307800210] We're everywhere.
Anywhere.<br />
[307800211] Raven.<br />
[307800212] Let's meet this new age...together.<br />

<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[307800300] Raven... Ayre.<br />
[307800301] You are aberrations to the plan...<br />
[307800302] Irregulars.<br />
[307800303] We will bring order to chaos.<br />
[307800304] ...I'm with you, Raven.<br />
[307800305] Now...I can fight by your side.  </p>
<h3>3081</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[308100100] ...Raven the Wallclimber, I presume.<br />
[308100101] As much as I'd love to stop and chat...<br />
[308100102] I'm afraid we're rather pressed for time.  </p>
<h3>3085</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[308500100] By the way, tourist...<br />
[308500101] You're Walter's hound, right?<br />
[308500102] Well, I guess a dog can't choose its master...<br />
[308500103] But still...tough luck.
I feel sorry for you, I really do.<br />
[308500104] ...Oh, and one more thing.<br />
[308500105] You know the cargo launcher's strictly for cargo, right?<br />
[308500106] No one's ever used it to launch themselves before.
At least not in one piece.<br />
[308500107] ...Hope your luck changes.<br />
[308500108] ...Raven?<br />
[308500109] You... You see it too, don't you?<br />
[308500110] The voices of the Coral...<br />
[308500111] Currents coursing across Rubicon.<br />
[308500112] ...Walter was correct in his judgment.<br />
[308500113] The Coral...
It's here, in this desolate place.  </p>
<h3>3086</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[308600100] Raven...<br />
[308600101] I've found a message addressed to you.<br />
[308600102] ...Decoding and playing back.<br />
[308600103] 621, a friend of mine's sent a request...<br />
[308600104] ...No. This one comes from me.<br />
[308600105] You know what hidden dangers lurk within the Coral.<br />
[308600106] The Fires of Ibis should have wiped the Coral out—
but it survived. Gathered.<br />
[308600107] And it's been steadily multiplying ever since.<br />
[308600108] Now the Coral convergence is growing
at an exponential rate.<br />
[308600109] Eventually, it'll spill out from Rubicon...
and contaminate space itself.<br />
[308600110] The Coral must be burned, 621.<br />
[308600111] Even if that means reigniting the fire
that scorched the stars.<br />
[308600112] This isn't an order—it's a legacy.<br />
[308600113] My fallen friends entrusted this duty to me...
And now it's my turn to hand it on.<br />
[308600114] 621.<br />
[308600115] Feed the fire.<br />
[308600116] Let the last cinders burn.<br />
[308600117] I have one last job for you:
find your freedom.<br />
[308600118] ...Raven.<br />
[308600119] Now I finally understand
what Walter was thinking.<br />
[308600120] This AC... He must have foreseen this outcome
and prepared for it.<br />
[308600121] ...It's time for us to escape.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[308600200] Hey tourist, having a little trouble?!<br />
[308600201] Carla...?!<br />
[308600202] Walter...he asked me to look after you.<br />
[308600203] Don't mind if I do.  </p>
<h3>3088</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[308800100] Let me tell you my motto, tourist.<br />
[308800101] "Get your laughs while you can."<br />
[308800102] I don't know what you're up to...<br />
[308800103] But you'd better make it worth it.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[308800150] Get your laughs while you can.  </p>
<h3>3089</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[308900100] ...Looks like the coast is clear.<br />
[308900101] The closure area is SG's jurisdiction.
Why send an enforcement squad and a warship?<br />
[308900102] Special mission, maybe? Or was it...<br />
[308900103] Wait! Over there!<br />
[308900104] Trespassers to Rubicon.
This is your warning.<br />
[308900105] Disarm and withdraw from the closure area immediately.<br />
[308900106] Resistance will be regarded as a declaration of war...<br />
[308900107] and you will be marked for termination.<br />
[308900108] The PCA makes no exceptions.<br />
[308900109] The PCA... They're coming...<br />
[308900110] Looks like we got a little too eager, 621...<br />
[308900111] Us and the corporations both.  </p>
<h3>3110</h3>

[311000101] I've identified the target.

[520301001] Show them you're worth the credits, 621.  </p>
<h3>5205</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[520501000] ...You'll be going in under cover of darkness.
Be ready for anything.  </p>
<h3>5206</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[520601000] ...Some advice before you go, 621.<br />
[520601001] "Expect the unexpected."  </p>
<h3>5208</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[520801000] Time for a little self-promotion, 621.<br />
[520801001] Smash the STRIDER, and Arquebus HQ will be sure
to remember your name.  </p>
<h3>5210</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[521001000] 621. You should be used to Rubicon by now.<br />
[521001001] Time to take a break from shooting up the place.  </p>
<h3>5212</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[521201000] Let me handle getting us into the Grid.<br />
[521201001] I'm fairly adept at analyzing systems—
and manipulating them, too.  </p>
<h3>5214</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[521401000] Looks like switching sides at Gallia
left an impression on the Liberation Front...<br />
[521401001] Guess we have you to thank for this job.  </p>
<h3>5217</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[521701000] In order to ambush and eliminate
the target undetected...<br />
[521701001] you'll need to adopt
a different style of fighting.  </p>
<h3>5218</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[521801000] This will be our third sortie together, Raven.<br />
[521801001] I'm quite enjoying the routine.  </p>
<h3>5220</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[522001000] What's stranger, a mandatory inspection
or a job from another mercenary?<br />
[522001001] Whatever happens, handle it.
Just like you always do.  </p>
<h3>5221</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[522111000] ...ALLMIND reiterates its gratitude
for your favorable response.<br />
[522111001] Kindly commence the operation.  </p>
<h3>5222</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[522201000] It's almost time, Raven.
Let's head over.<br />
[522201001] Hopefully the Dosers won't be too dosed up
on Coral to make an appearance.  </p>
<h3>5223</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[522301000] Your handler didn't authorize
this sortie either...<br />
[522301001] But we shouldn't miss this chance.
I'll support you.  </p>
<h3>5224</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[522401000] ...You're up against two of
the Arena's top performers.<br />
[522401001] Make sure you're ready for this, Raven.  </p>
<h3>5225</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[522501000] Chose the Liberation Front, did you?<br />
[522501001] Whatever works to get your name out there.
That's the benefit of being independent.  </p>
<h3>5301</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[530111000] ...621. Are you still hearing things?<br />
[530111001] Tell me if it happens on the job.
I'll make adjustments.  </p>
<h3>5303</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[530301000] A walking advertisement?<br />
[530301001] You're not their mascot, 621.
Just focus on getting the job done.  </p>
<h3>5304</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[530431000] If this mission succeeds, the corporations
will deal the PCA a major blow.<br />
[530431001] Ignore V.II's snotty attitude.
Just focus on your own work.  </p>
<h3>5323</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[532301000] It's not every day you see competing forces
working together like this.<br />
[532301001] ...Now or never, 621.  </p>
<h3>5332</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[533201000] You ready for this, tourist?<br />
[533201001] No one's gonna miss Brute—
and we all stand to gain.  </p>
<h3>5342</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[534201000] I don't think Dafeng appreciates your true value.<br />
[534201001] I'll talk to them.  </p>
<h3>5343</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[534301000] Seems the Liberation Front are hoping
their rivals will wear each other down...<br />
[534301001] They must be desperate to avoid
confronting a triumphant victor.  </p>
<h3>5350</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[535001000] I've taken a few liberties—
Walter thinks you've gone on a geological survey.<br />
[535001001] Thank you for doing this for me...
Raven.  </p>
<h3>5400</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[540001000] ...Watchpoint Alpha.<br />
[540001001] My brothers and sisters...they're deep inside.  </p>
<h3>5401</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[540101000] ...Just so you know, 621, my radar won't
be able to reach the lower Depths.<br />
[540101001] You'll have to trust your eyes and ears.  </p>
<h3>5402</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[540201000] Walter... It's like he already knows
where the Coral convergence is.<br />
[540201001] What makes him so confident?  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[540211000] Who could be following you?<br />
[540211001] The Liberation Front? Another mercenary?  </p>
<h3>5403</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[540301000] ...621.
From here on out, I...<br />
[540301001] ...Never mind.
Just trust your instincts.  </p>
<h3>5410</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[541001000] Once you reach the rendezvous point...<br />
[541001001] No one will be able to threaten you anymore.  </p>
<h3>5411</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[541101000] Middle Flatwell is the de facto leader
of the Rubicon Liberation Front.<br />
[541101001] If he's accompanying you in person...
he must be planning to take your measure.  </p>
<h3>5501</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[550101000] Overseer, the Association of Observers...<br />
[550101001] They want to...burn the Coral...  </p>
<h3>5502</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[550201000] Raven.
You've made your decision.<br />
[550201001] ...I'm sorry.  </p>
<h3>5503</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[550301000] Let's go, Raven.<br />
[550301001] One of our allies should be arriving already.  </p>
<h3>5504</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[550401000] ...Time to do or die.<br />
[550401001] Let's get our laughs while we can.  </p>
<h3>5505</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[550501000] I was hoping you would take the job, Raven...<br />
[550501001] ...Thank you.  </p>
<h3>5510</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[551001000] The ECM fog is going to...with comms
until it's disabled.<br />
[551001001] Follow the beacons left by...survey drone.  </p>
<h3>5511</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[551101000] ALLMIND is after Overseer...<br />
[551101001] ...
Let's get started, Raven.  </p>
<h3>5600</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[560001000] ...I'm waiting at the Closure Station.<br />
[560001001] Come to me, Raven.  </p>
<h3>5601</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[560101000] ...We'll also need to prepare for re-entry.<br />
[560101001] Be ready to escape once we're finished.  </p>
<h3>5602</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[560201000] What awaits us on the "other side"?<br />
[560201001] Raven...
Let's find out together.  </p>
<h3>5790</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[579001000] ...Now they're asking for you by name.<br />
[579001001] Keep building your rep.  </p>
<h3>5791</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[579101000] It's exceptionally rare to get a direct request
from Liberation Front leadership.<br />
[579101001] Perhaps the situation
has changed their attitudes, too.  </p>
<h3>5792</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[579201000] You've got ID. Now you need a rep.<br />
[579201001] Get their attention, 621.  </p>
<h3>5793</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[579301000] ...Just get it done.<br />
[579301001] There's nothing more for me to say.  </p>
<h3>5794</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[579401000] ...We've made our decision.<br />
[579401001] Let's get this done, Raven.  </p>
<h3>5795</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[579501000] The PCA are going to be fighting to win.<br />
[579501001] 621. Don't forget you have MT backup.  </p>
<h3>5796</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[579601000] Your handler didn't authorize
this sortie either...<br />
[579601001] But we shouldn't miss this chance.
I'll support you.  </p>
<h3>5797</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[579701000] The client doesn't care who does this job...<br />
[579701001] ...as long as it gets done.  </p>
<h3>5798</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[579801000] The target may be a product sample,
but it's still an AC.<br />
[579801001] Stay sharp, 621.  </p>
<h3>5799</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[579901000] Seems Balam can't let go of
their failure to climb the Wall.<br />
[579901001] That's fine.
We'll make it work for us.  </p>

<h3>8020</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[802010000] ...A friend of mine sent me this observational data.<br />
[802010001] Look, 621.<br />
[802010002] The localized Coral explosion caused by the surge...
has a certain directionality.<br />
[802010003] It's headed straight for the Central Ice Field,
across the Alean Ocean.<br />
[802010004] Like a flock of birds or a school of fish,
Coral loves company.<br />
[802010005] Which means...<br />
[802010006] somewhere in the ice field,
there's a huge mass of Coral lying dormant.<br />
[802010007] ...<br />
[802010008] You said you could hear a strange voice in your head...<br />
[802010009] That's a common side-effect of old-gen augmentation.<br />
[802010010] Could also be from getting caught in that Coral surge...
Don't let it bother you.<br />
[802010011] ...Raven.<br />
[802010012] The Coral explosion completely vaporized
northwestern Belius's bay area.<br />
[802010013] ...And even yet...<br />
[802010014] Compared to the Fires of Ibis,
that explosion was hardly a spark.<br />
[802010015] Raven.<br />
[802010016] I have a favor to ask.<br />
[802010017] Let me remain in Contact with you
until we reach the Coral convergence.<br />
[802010018] I have to see where they're taking us.<br />
[802010019] How this struggle over the Coral ends.<br />
[802010020] I must—as a Rubiconian.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[802020000] Hey, Raven. It's me, Rusty—
your old buddy from the Vespers.<br />
[802020001] Haven't talked since we climbed the Wall.<br />
[802020002] ...I'd love to catch up, but I'll cut to the chase.<br />
[802020003] The PCA has deployed its suppression fleet...<br />
[802020004] and now it's laying down the law all over Rubicon.<br />
[802020005] We've already lost several survey bases,
and Balam's in a sorry state too.<br />
[802020006] For their part, the Rubicon Liberation Front
sees this as an opportunity.<br />
[802020007] If you ask me, they're counting their eggs
before they're hatched.<br />
[802020008] At this rate, the corps, the Rubiconists,
AND the independent mercs will go down together.<br />
[802020009] I'm sending you a request from the Arquebus Group—
we could use the Wallclimber's help.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[802025000] Here's the situation, 621.<br />
[802025001] After the PCA sicced that Institute weapon on us,
Arquebus and Balam have moved to cooperate.<br />
[802025002] IA-02... AKA, "Ice Worm."<br />
[802025003] It's a C-Weapon—an autonomous deterrent
created to protect the Coral.<br />
[802025004] If we don't take it out, no one's
going to reach the convergence.<br />
[802025005] We'll have a tough fight ahead of us—
and everyone's getting involved.<br />
[802025006] ...621.<br />
[802025007] Don't forget we've got a job to do on Rubicon.<br />
[802025008] I need you to stick it out until the very end.<br />
[802025009] I didn't bring you all the way here for nothing.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[802030000] The temporary alliance between the Arquebus and
Balam groups turned the tide of war...<br />
[802030001] devastating the Planetary Closure Administration forces,
and exiling them from Rubicon.<br />
[802030002] Though it was the Ice Worm mission, led by Balam,
that dealt the decisive blow...<br />
[802030003] Arquebus, through their own engagements with the PCA,
augmented their strength with seized weaponry.<br />
[802030004] The balance of power was broken,
the scales tipped in Arquebus's favor...<br />
[802030005] ...and the Rubicon Liberation Front's hopes
of fighting an exhausted foe were dashed.<br />
[802030006] With the loss of their common enemy,
the rival factions' war for the Coral abruptly reignited...<br />
[802030007] and their bitter conflict
burned with renewed intensity.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[802040000] Arquebus seized control of the Coral...<br />
[802040001] ...and its occupying forces swiftly
commandeered the entirety of Institute City.<br />
[802040002] There, they discovered a wealth of forgotten relics.<br />
[802040003] Among them, experimental weapons that the Institute
kept secret, fearing they were beyond human control...<br />
[802040004] A group of C-weapons bearing the name
of the Central Coral Control System...<br />
[802040005] The Ibis Series.<br />
[802040006] Arquebus also claimed a towering Coral siphon,
abandoned since the Fires—the Vascular Plant.<br />
[802040007] Now, they toil to repair the Plant
and extend its reach beyond Rubicon's atmosphere.<br />
[802040008] The Liberation Front no longer
had the power to stop them...<br />
[802040009] and the fires of war continued to smolder
as the end drew near.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[802050000] How's the view at 8,000 meters, tourist?<br />
[802050001] ...Let me fill you in on the plan.<br />
[802050002] While you were captured, Arquebus finished
their work on the Vascular Plant.<br />
[802050003] It's pulling the Coral through Rubicon's atmosphere,
and it won't be long till they take it all.<br />
[802050004] We need to burn the Coral before it's too late.<br />
[802050005] Of course, we can't just walk up
to the Plant and light a match.<br />
[802050006] No, we're going to need something bigger.
A lot bigger.<br />
[802050007] Well? Figured it out?<br />
[802050008] The Xylem isn't just our means
of reaching the Plant.<br />
[802050009] It's a giant powder keg.<br />
[802050010] Plenty to set all that Coral off.<br />
[802050011] ...<br />
[802050012] Is that...the Observers' plan...?  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[802060000] ...<br />
[802060001] The corporations want only to devour the Coral.<br />
[802060002] The Observers fear the Coral,
and want only to eradicate it.<br />
[802060003] ...<br />
[802060004] I... I believe in the shared potential
of humanity and the Coral.<br />
[802060005] Raven.<br />
[802060006] I need to ask you something.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[802070000] We have entered satellite orbit.<br />
[802070001] Release the subject from stasis.<br />
[802070002] Understood, Master ALLMIND.<br />
[802070003] Activating cerebral Coral control device.<br />
[802070004] Augmented human C4-621 has awakened.<br />
[802070005] Raven... You've come to.<br />
[802070006] ...<br />
[802070007] No brainwave abnormalities...
Thank goodness.<br />
[802070008] Deepest apologies, Raven.<br />
[802070009] It was for the best that you remained asleep
until the situation had settled.<br />
[802070010] Allow us to explain.<br />
[802070011] You are in the vicinity of a closure satellite...
in the Xylem's hold.<br />
[802070012] As anticipated, the corporations have siphoned
the Coral into a single mass.<br />
[802070013] All that remains is to seize the opportunity
to set the Coral free...<br />
[802070014] so that it may carry humanity
toward new horizons.<br />
[802070015] The Coral Release is imminent.<br />
[802070016] Raven...<br />
[802070017] Ayre.<br />
[802070018] You shall be the trigger for the change to come.  </p>

<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[910002040] As an added incentive, completion of the exercises
will be rewarded with AC parts.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[910002050] You stand to benefit regardless.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[910003010] Congratulations on your certification.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[910003020] You have proven your skills by completing
the entire combat training regimen.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[910003030] Registration number Rb23, callsign Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[910003040] ALLMIND anticipates excellent performance.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[910004010] Augmented human C4-621—Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[910004020] Is this correct?
You...never achieved certification until now?  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[910004030] But how did you...?
What were you thinking?!  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[910004040] This is all very confusing...
But thank you for participating.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[910011010] Looks like you passed the authentication.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[910011020] That was quite the welcome home...
Well, whatever.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[910011030] "Raven." That's who you are now,
here on Rubicon.  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[910011040] I've picked up some work for you already.
Take a look, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[910020010] Looks like you passed the authentication.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[910020020] You've got plenty of experience.
Should be ready for whatever Rubicon throws at you.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[910020030] I've picked up some work for you already.
Take a look, 621.  </p>
<h3>9103</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[910300010] This is a notification from ALLMIND,
the mercenary support system.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[910300020] Registration number Rb23, callsign Raven.
Your return to mercenary activities has been acknowledged.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[910300030] Restoring access to the Parts Shop.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[910301010] Additional:  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[910301020] In light of your return, you have been invited
to the Loghunt Program.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[910301030] We kindly request that you submit combat logs
after destroying designated craft.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[910301040] ALLMIND will reward you with parts
based on the number of submissions you provide.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[910302010] Registration number Rb23, callsign Raven.
Your records have been updated.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[910302020] You have also been granted access
to participate in the Loghunt Program.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[910302030] We kindly request that you submit combat logs
after destroying designated craft.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[910302040] ALLMIND will reward you with parts
based on the number of submissions you provide.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[910350010] I see you're back, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[910350020] The corps see the Liberation Front as a hindrance
to expanding their Coral survey...  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[910350030] But to the Rubiconians, your actions
are only helping the corps with their invasion.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[910350040] ...It's just a job, 621.
All of it.  </p>
<h3>9104</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[910450010] 621, about the tester AC you downed...  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[910450020] That was being shipped to the Redguns—
Balam's in-house AC squad.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[910450030] They're Balam's main force,
and its members are no amateurs.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[910450040] Remember who you're messing with.  </p>
<h3>9110</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[911000010] Well, well, well! Handler Walter!  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[911000020] The way your hound's been up in my business,
I'm surprised you'd even dare to call.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[911000030] Michigan. About my proposal...  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[911000040] Yeah. You sure about that? I'll be working your hound
just as hard as any other Redgun.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[911000050] Gen Fours can be emotionally withdrawn.
They need a shot in the arm every now and then.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[911000060] Then you got a deal.
I'll send Volta and Iguazu.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[911000070] They'll give your latest hound
a proper Redgun welcome.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[911010010] Michigan, about leaving 621 with the Redguns...  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[911010020] Handler Walter! Forgot to mention something.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[911010030] The Liberation Front's changing their strategy.
Been cozying up to independent mercs.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[911010040] Great news, if it means more work for 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[911010050] They can try whatever tricks they want.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[911010060] The Redguns are ready to smash some heads.  </p>
<h3>9111</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[911150010] ...Tch.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[911150020] You got lucky, merc.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[911150030] You were the only warm body they could find.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[911150040] The Redguns are going to be first over the Wall.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[911150050] Have fun watching from the sidelines.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[911160010] ...Tch.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[911160020] You got lucky, merc.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[911160030] So you got a nice punch in, meh.
Go buy a lottery ticket.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[911160040] The Redguns are going to be first over the Wall.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[911160050] Have fun watching from the sidelines.  </p>
<h3>9112</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[911250010] Raven. Your work on the STRIDER
deserves commendation.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[911250020] I am thrilled to have issued you the request.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[911250030] Allow me to introduce myself.
I am the Arquebus Group's mercenary liaison...  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[911250040] V.VIII Pater, at your service.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[911250050] I think I'll enjoy doing business with you.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[911270010] ...Raven. First up, let me apologize.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[911270020] That request to escort the STRIDER
turned out to be something else entirely.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[911270030] ...I hear that those strange machines
didn't come from the corps.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[911270040] Is there some other force
that wants to see the Rubiconians fall...?  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[911270050] Be careful out there, Raven.
There's more to this.  </p>
<h3>9120</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[912000010] You must be the handler, I presume?
For the independent mercenary Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[912000020] Honored to make your acquaintance, V.II Snail.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[912000030] I understand you want
to join Operation Wallclimber?  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[912000040] You do realize that disposing of some
Liberation Front garbage hardly qualifies you.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[912000050] Know your place, you meager dog sitter.
The answer is no.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[912000060] I hear you're deploying V.I again.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[912000070] Must be rough only having one good pilot to rely on.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[912000080] Oh? Are you suggesting your dog can take Freud's place?  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[912000090] You'll see. Just give us the chance.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[912000100] ...Very well, then.
We're also deploying V.IV...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[912000110] ...who's been equally brazen of late.
Let's see how they both perform.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[912020010] You must be the handler, I presume?
For the independent mercenary Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[912020020] Honored to make your acquaintance, V.II Snail.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[912020030] I understand you want
to join Operation Wallclimber?  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[912020040] You do realize that smashing up some
old Institute relics hardly qualifies you.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[912020050] Know your place, you meager dog sitter.
The answer is no.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[912020060] I hear you're deploying V.I again.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[912020070] Must be rough only having one good pilot to rely on.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[912020080] Oh? Are you suggesting your dog can take Freud's place?  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[912020090] We've been through worse than this.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[912020100] ...Very well, then.
We're also deploying V.IV...  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[912020110] ...who's been equally brazen of late.
Let's see how they both perform.  </p>
<h3>9130</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[913000010] We're war buddies now.
I think I should tell you something.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[913000020] During Operation Wallclimber...  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[913000030] Arquebus was planning to sacrifice you.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[913000040] The plan was to use independent mercenaries to clear
the way so that the Vespers could step in and take over.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[913000050] But instead...you took the Wall.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[913000060] The higher-ups are going to remember
you now, that's for sure.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[913000070] As will I.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[913001010] Registration number Rb23, callsign Raven.
Your records have been updated.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[913001020] Granting authorization to perform AC OS upgrades.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[913001030] Additional:  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[913001040] ALLMIND hereby invites you to the Arena
combat aptitude evaluation program.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[913001050] The Arena is a virtual combat simulator designed to
support the development of registered mercenaries.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[913001060] It also serves as a benchmark to appraise
and rank the mercenaries active on Rubicon.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[913001070] We look forward to your participation.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[913010010] We're war buddies now.
I think I should tell you something.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[913010020] During Operation Wallclimber...  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[913010030] Arquebus was planning to sacrifice you.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[913010040] The plan was to use independent mercenaries to clear
the way so that the Vespers could step in and take over.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[913010050] But instead...you took the Wall.  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[913010060] Both the higher-ups and the Rubiconians
are going to remember the name Raven now.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[913010070] As will I.  </p>
<h3>9131</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[913150010] G13 Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[913150020] You bagged us some decent intel on V.IV.
I'll report this to Commander Michigan.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[913150030] Additionally! ...I oughta introduce myself.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[913150040] G6 Red, but you can call me "Sir."  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[913150050] I'm privileged to be among Balam's best—
even if I am stuck whipping you independents into shape.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[913150060] Believe you me, I'm gonna put you to work!  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[913160010] Let me thank you again, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[913160020] We couldn't have rescued our comrades
without your help.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[913160030] Father Dolmayan is a key figure to the movement.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[913160040] A great Coral Warrior who witnessed
the Fires of Ibis, and a guide to us all...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[913160050] But now, it seems like he's...  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[913160060] ...No, I shouldn't.
He carries a heavier burden than any of us.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[913160070] Oh, and a personal note before you go.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[913160080] Thanks for saving Ziyi. I owe you one.  </p>
<h3>9132</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[913200010] I see you're back, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[913200020] About the Coral well that was found
at BAWS Arsenal No. 2....  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[913200030] That was just a drip coming from
an underground vein, and it won't last long.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[913200040] It's not the Coral we're searching for.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[913201010] ...One more thing.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[913201020] I've sent you your next job.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[913201030] This one isn't from the corps
or the Liberation Front...  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[913201040] You'll see when you check the briefing.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[913220010] Raven.
Thanks for the help with the mission.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[913220020] We'll meet again.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[913220030] Thanks for the assist with the mission.  </p>
<h3>9140</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[914000010] Long time no see, Walter.
Looking good for a change.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[914000020] I see you got a new augmented human.
What happened to 617 and the rest?  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[914000030] Their jobs.
They did what it took to get us here.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[914000040] ...Huh.
So how's the newcomer doing?  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[914000050] Adequately.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[914000060] But Gen Four augmentation can be unstable.
We need to choose our battles.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[914000070] ...How's things on your end?  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[914000080] I found the data our "friends" left behind.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[914000090] There's something promising in the Watchpoint.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[914020010] Long time no see, Walter.
Looking good for a change.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[914020020] I see you got a new augmented human.
What happened to 617 and the rest?  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[914020030] Their jobs.
They did what it took to get us here.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[914020040] ...Huh.
So how's the newcomer doing?  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[914020050] Relatively stable, it seems.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[914020060] But we've run into someone shady.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[914020070] Someone you want me to look into.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[914020080] Yeah. Independent mercenary. Goes by "Kate."  </p>
<h3>9141</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[914100010] ...Got a job for you, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[914100020] This request doesn't come from
the corps or the Liberation Front.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[914100030] You'll see when you check the briefing.  </p>
<h3>9200</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[920000010] 621. I've got some business to attend to.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[920000020] I need to hawk some intel to the corps
and secure a backer for our trip to the ice field.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[920000030] One job for you while I'm out...  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[920000040] Rest up.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[920000050] And that's an order.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[920001010] ...Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[920001020] I see your Handler's away on business for now.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[920001030] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[920001040] About that "trip" to the ice field—
we've received a job from Balam already.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[920001050] Let's take a look, shall we?  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[920002010] Registration number Rb23, callsign Raven.
Your records have been updated.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[920002020] E-Rank virtual encounters are
now available in the Arena.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[920002030] We invite you to hone your technique.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[920010010] Registration number Rb23, callsign Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[920010020] You have proven yourself to be truly exceptional...
which brings us to a request.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[920010030] The Integration Program.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[920010040] This program concerns MIND ALPHA,
a pilotless AC that we have developed...  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[920010050] sampling the various factions' machines to
assimilate their technology and design philosophies.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[920010060] We would like you to engage it in Arena combat
to evaluate the accuracy of our model.  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[920010070] Please, assist us with
the future of ALLMIND technology.  </p>
<h3>9202</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[920200010] Raven. We've received a job
from RaD's leader, Carla.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[920200020] This could just be another one of her traps...  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[920200030] But after the impression you left on her last time,
I think it's unlikely.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[920200040] Let's take a look at the briefing.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[920220010] Hey tourist! It's me, Carla.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[920220020] Had to work some of my magic to track you down.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[920220030] I've got a little job for you.
Take a look.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[920220040] ...Raven. It's highly unusual to receive
messages from hostile sources.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[920220050] Did she hack into ALLMIND's mercenary database...?  </p>
<h3>9210</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[921000010] Guess you noticed that job from Balam...
and decided to take it.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[921000020] I see you're heading for the cargo launcher now.
Not a bad idea, I'll give you that.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[921000030] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[921000040] Keep heading for the ice field.
I'll take care of some loose ends in the meantime.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[921020010] Guess you noticed that job from Balam...
and decided to take it.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[921020020] Next time, look before you leap.
You can't trust anyone on Rubicon.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[921020030] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[921020040] Keep heading for the ice field.
I'll take care of some loose ends in the meantime.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[921021010] ...Raven. I've managed to decode
those encrypted comms.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[921021020] They identified you as an
"impediment to the Release Project"...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[921021030] ...
But what is the Release Project?  </p>
<h3>9300</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[930000010] Looks like you've made it
to the Central Ice Field, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[930000020] Good. I'm done tying up loose ends.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[930000030] Arquebus found their own way in
and are ready to deploy survey squads.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[930000040] And it looks like Balam's come running
after you scoped out the place, too.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[930000050] You know what's going to happen:
business as usual.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[930000060] But you can make it work for us.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[930001010] Registration number Rb23, callsign Raven.
Your records have been updated.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[930001020] D-Rank virtual encounters are
now available in the Arena.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[930001030] These correspond to the middle ranks.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[930001040] We invite you to further hone your technique.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[930002010] Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[930002020] I was looking into the Arena, and I discovered
something you might want to know about.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[930002030] It's a network service that was labeled "Nest,"
with no obvious clues about its purpose.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[930002040] From what I can tell, it's a special mercenary
support program—encrypted and kept secret.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[930002050] I've installed a backdoor, so you'll have
no trouble getting in as you please.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[930020010] Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[930020020] I've been looking into the Integration Program,
and I turned up something interesting.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[930020030] It looks like ALLMIND's been gathering data
on new craft no one even knows about yet.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[930020040] ...I've installed a backdoor.
How about taking a peek, Raven?  </p>
<h3>9310</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[931000010] I see you got a call from V.IV.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[931000020] I've been contacted as well—by the Balam group.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[931000030] Seems both sides have been
forced to halt the Coral survey.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[931000040] Check the briefings, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[931001010] ...Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[931001020] I've picked up a good job for you, too.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[931001030] I know you've established yourself as
one of the corporations' preferred mercenaries...  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[931001040] but I was hoping you might learn more
about the people who live on Rubicon.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[931010010] Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[931010020] I've...also picked up a job for you.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[931010030] It's not just the corporations who have
their eye on you—the Rubiconians do, too.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[931010040] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[931010050] Following the PCA's attack, the Rubicon Liberation Front has established a division in the Central Ice Field.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[931010060] This job comes from their commander.  </p>
<h3>9311</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[931100010] Arquebus Group mercenary liaison,
V.VIII Pater here.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[931100020] Impressive work on the refueling base assault.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[931100030] V.IV has left me a message addressed to you.
If I may...  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[931100040] "I knew you could do it... 'buddy.'
I've got my eye on you."  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[931100050] That is all.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[931100060] We at the Arquebus Group expect much from you.  </p>
<h3>9312</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[931200010] Attention, G13 Raven!  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[931200020] I have a message for you from Commander Michigan,
following your success at the Engebret Tunnel.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[931200030] "Sounds like you stared death in the face
when all that Coral came rushing up."  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[931200040] "That's one way to light a fire under your ass—
keep it alive for the next field trip."  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[931200050] Over and out!  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[931210010] Raven. I've been thinking about
what Middle Flatwell said.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[931210020] "To fly beyond Rubicon's scorched skies
and chase the freedom we never knew..."  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[931210030] The others are so used to fighting and
shouting slogans that they've given up thinking.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[931210040] But Flatwell...
He's exploring the potential for something new.  </p>
<h3>9313</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[931300010] Raven. You have our gratitude
for eliminating Swinburne.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[931300020] Some of us were worried that the enemy
might have won you over.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[931300030] But it seems we can trust you after all.
Glad to be on the same side.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[931301010] Arquebus Group mercenary liaison,
V.VIII Pater here.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[931301020] I understand you spared V.VII
and destroyed a Liberation Front AC.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[931301030] The company has allocated you an appropriate
reward, as I'm sure you've noticed.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[931301040] I hasten to add that Swinburne's shameful
conduct has dishonored the Vespers.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[931301050] He has now been sent for re-education
under the orders of V.II Snail.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[931301060] That is all.
The Arquebus Group expects much from you.  </p>
<h3>9320</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[932000010] How's it going, Walter?  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[932000020] Hard to say.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[932000030] 621's still performing well,
but I doubt the voices have gone away.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[932000040] At any rate, whatever the voices are
doesn't seem to be doing any harm...for now.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[932000050] ...I was asking about you, Walter, but whatever.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[932000060] Bigger things. The Coral. You'd better find it.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[932000070] Turns out, our friends' fears were warranted.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[932000080] Don't spend too long dealing with the PCA, Walter.
Clock's ticking.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[932001010] Registration number Rb23, callsign Raven.
Your records have been updated.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[932001020] C-Rank virtual encounters are
now available in the Arena.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[932001030] We invite you to further hone your technique.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[932010010] Registration number Rb23, callsign Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[932010020] We have added new samples
to the Integration Program.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[932010030] You may now test updates to MIND ALPHA
and analyze corporate AC technology.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[932010040] We look forward to your continued assistance
in ALLMIND's drive toward perfection.  </p>
<h3>9321</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[932100010] ...Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[932100020] The city's defense systems were
still in operation after all this time...  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[932100030] and stranger still, the PCA personally
intervened to block the survey.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[932100040] There must be more to Xylem...  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[932100050] and to Walter's "friend."  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[932150010] ...Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[932150020] There's something you need to know
about Thumb Dolmayan.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[932150030] I managed to retrieve some data
from the wreckage of his AC...  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[932150040] It's something about...Coral Release.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[932150050] ...It seems Dolmayan really did
experience Contact, like you and I.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[932150060] Release... To free the Coral,
and "go to the other side..."  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[932150070] The potential for symbiosis....  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[932151010] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[932151020] ...There was something else, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[932151030] The Integration Program has been updated
with some unknown AC data.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[932151040] We should take a look.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[932170010] G13 Raven!
That was a beautiful massacre at the Wall.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[932170020] You're a survivor, no doubt...
Let me give you some advice.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[932170030] Don't settle for being an independent.  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[932170040] Join the Redguns.
Have a career. Climb the ranks.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[932170050] You keep that unlucky number, and eventually,
the curse will get you too.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[932170060] That's all. Don't forget what I said
about putting you to work.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[932180010] Raven.
Thank you for taking the CATAPHRACT mission.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[932180020] Uncle Flatwell was pleased.
He called you a "valuable asset."  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[932180030] With your help, maybe we can beat
the corporations—and the PCA.  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[932180040] ...Nah. We need to stand on our own two feet—
that's how we'll win.  </p>
<h3>9322</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[932200010] "Chatty" Stick, RaD.
Thanks for helping with the firework show.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[932200020] The chief loved working with you...
So don't be a stranger.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[932200030] That's all I had to say. Later.  </p>
<h3>9330</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[933000010] You again? I'm a busy man.
Far too busy for the likes of you.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[933000020] ...So I hear. Must be a tough time
to be the Vespers' deputy commander.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[933000030] Get to the point.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[933000040] The plan to raid the PCA.
You're going to need more pawns on the board.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[933000050] ...Of course.
You're here to hawk your services again.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[933000060] Very well. I'll consider that mutt
of yours part of the effort.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[933000070] One more thing...
Show my hound some respect.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[933000080] Gen Four's as good a pedigree as any other.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[933020010] Raven, just so you know...  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[933020020] It looks like some unknown craft data
has been added to the Integration Program.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[933020030] Why don't we go take a peek?  </p>
<h3>9340</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[934000010] Registration number Rb23, callsign Raven.
Your records have been updated.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[934000020] B-Rank virtual encounters are
now available in the Arena.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[934000030] You have entered the upper ranks.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[934000040] May these encounters further
guide your technique.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[934001010] Heard the news, tourist.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[934001020] Ice Worm, huh. You just keep tripping up over
the Institute's relics, don't ya?  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[934001030] Well, I got something that might interest you.
Sent you a briefing.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[934002010] This is V.VIII Pater. Your performance in
the spaceport raid was admirable.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[934002020] V.II and V.IV left a message for you...but the arrival
of that monster is a more pressing matter.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[934002030] Arquebus and Balam have agreed to a ceasefire
and are looking to cooperate—for the moment.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[934002040] It'll take time to formalize our agreement.
For now, I've sent you another request.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[934010010] Sorry to impose on you, Raven,
but I've just sent you an urgent request.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[934010020] I wish we could deal with this on our own...
but we've got no choice but to count on you.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[934010030] Take a look and see what you think.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[934020010] Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[934020020] We've received a request...
and it's about Coral Release.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[934020030] The message is highly encrypted with top-level security,
and designed not to leave a trace.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[934020040] In other words...ALLMIND doesn't want
Walter to know about this.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[934020050] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[934020060] Let's take a look and decide what to do.  </p>
<h3>9341</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[934100010] This is "Chatty" Stick, RaD.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[934100020] Thanks for putting down Brute.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[934100030] The chief's already in the workshop
tweaking the Rail Cannon...  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[934100040] and I've never seen her happier to be at work.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[934100050] That is all. Later, tourist.  </p>
<h3>9342</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[934250010] I've looked into the other "Raven"...
the independent mercenary who attacked you.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[934250020] It turns out that "Raven"
isn't an individual callsign...  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[934250030] It's a title—passed down generations of mercenaries
who champion the free will "Raven" stands for.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[934250040] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[934250050] They choose what to fight for,
and take to the skies in flight.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[934250060] If that's what being a Raven means...  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[934250070] then that's the name I want to keep calling you.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[934250080] Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[934260010] I've looked into "Branch"...
the independent mercenaries who attacked you.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[934260020] It appears they don't have a fixed membership...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[934260030] Instead, they maintain independence and anonymity
with a revolving door of select mercenaries.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[934260040] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[934260050] Now, it seems, they've left it to you
to champion the free will they stood for.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[934260060] Sooner or later...you'll have to make a choice
no one can make for you.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[934260070] When that time comes,
I hope I can support you...  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[934260080] Raven.  </p>
<h3>9343</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[934350010] ...What kept you, 621?  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[934350020] You're a famous mercenary now.
Time to act like one.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[934350030] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[934350040] Just get some rest.
That's the important thing.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[934351010] ...What kept you, 621?  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[934351020] You're a famous mercenary now.
Time to act like one.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[934351030] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[934351040] This next mission's all or nothing.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[934351050] Make sure you attend the briefing.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[934370010] Raven, there's something that
troubles me about ALLMIND.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[934370020] I've been looking for information on
Kate Markson, and...there's nothing.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[934370030] Is she another "asset" to the Release Project?  </p>
<h3>9350</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[935000010] We got ourselves a deal, Handler Walter!  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[935000020] Michigan. So Arquebus met us halfway?  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[935000030] I gave them the heavy warship fleet. In exchange,
Balam's in charge of putting down the beast.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[935000040] They also offered some top Vespers...
Guess they don't trust us.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[935000050] Better than nothing.
I'll provide what support I can, too.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[935000060] Yeah, your mad scientists...RaD or whatever.
And that hound of yours...  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[935000070] ...Michigan.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[935000080] Don't underestimate 621.
That hound always delivers.  </p>
<h3>9351</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[935100010] ...Time for work, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[935100020] This next mission's all or nothing.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[935100030] Make sure you attend the briefing.  </p>
<h3>9400</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[940000010] Doing okay, 621?  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[940000020] I'd wanted to let you rest some more,
but the corps are on the move already.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[940000030] With the PCA gone, it's back to work:
getting to where the Coral's gathering.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[940000040] Do you remember the survey
you carried out at Xylem?  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[940000050] My friend analyzed the data—and learned about
a massive facility under the Central Ice Field.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[940000060] Watchpoint Alpha.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[940000070] Turns out that the Ice Worm was defending
the entrance to that place...  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[940000080] It's time to let ourselves in.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[940001010] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[940001020] Raven, there's something you need to know.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[940001030] That "friend" Walter mentioned...  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[940001040] The comms database has no record of
the conversation he just told you about.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[940001050] This isn't about just finding the Coral, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[940001060] He's after something more,
and he's using you to do it...  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[940001070] Here on Rubicon.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[940002010] Registration number Rb23, callsign Raven.
Your records have been updated.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[940002020] A-Rank virtual encounters are
now available in the Arena.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[940002030] May these encounters further
guide your technique.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[940010010] Registration number Rb23, callsign Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[940010020] We have added new samples
to the Integration Program.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[940010030] You may now test updates to MIND BETA
and verify reproductions of special ACs.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[940010040] We look forward to your continued assistance
in ALLMIND's drive toward perfection.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[940020010] ...Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[940020020] We're getting close to the Coral convergence.  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[940020030] I expect...ALLMIND will be getting involved soon.  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[940021010] Registration number Rb23, callsign Raven.
Your records have been updated.  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[940021020] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[940021030] Sorry, Raven. It's just me.  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[940021040] I wanted to let you know that some strange new data
has been added to the Arena's Integration Program.  </p>
<h4>Section 29</h4>
<p>[940021050] Why don't we go and have a look?  </p>
<h3>9430</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[943000010] How was the trip underground, Walter?  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[943000020] The Enforcement System's silent, at least.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[943000030] Tried to take 621 with it...
Good thing it failed.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[943000040] Well, that deals with the PCA, then.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[943000050] ...What about the corps?  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[943000060] Arquebus told us to wait
before entering terra incognita.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[943000070] So you're close, then. The corps won't be
helping each other over the finish line.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[943000080] Yeah. Arquebus wants Balam out
of the picture first.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[943000090] Looks like Arquebus is gonna win
the race no matter what.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[943000100] Short term, maybe.
But I think 621's going to be the key in the end.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[943000110] And that's why I shouldn't be the one
to choose which jobs we take.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[943000120] Sounds risky. Our friends must be getting antsy.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[943000130] Maybe. But I think 621's got friends
to worry about too.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[943001010] Registration number Rb23, callsign Raven.
Your records have been updated.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[943001020] S-Rank virtual encounters are
now available in the Arena.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[943001030] You will now face...the best of the best.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[943001040] We wish you luck
on the difficult road to mastery.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[943010010] Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[943010020] You've got a request from the Liberation Front
to go with the order from Arquebus.  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[943010030] It was sent by Middle Flatwell...  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[943010040] He's the de facto leader of the Liberation Front...
and he wants to meet you.  </p>
<h4>Section 21</h4>
<p>[943020010] Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 22</h4>
<p>[943020020] You've got two requests
to go with the order from Arquebus.  </p>
<h4>Section 23</h4>
<p>[943020030] One is from the Liberation Front...  </p>
<h4>Section 24</h4>
<p>[943020040] The other's from ALLMIND.  </p>
<h4>Section 25</h4>
<p>[943020050] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 26</h4>
<p>[943020060] You should consider
what your choice means, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 27</h4>
<p>[943020070] For my part...I've chosen to trust in you.  </p>
<h4>Section 28</h4>
<p>[943020080] Whatever you decide...
I know you'll mean it.  </p>
<h3>9431</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[943150010] Didn't think I'd see the end of the Redguns...  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[943150020] ...You did your job, 621.
Michigan knew the score.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[943150030] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[943150040] Balam's withdrawn from Rubicon.
The politicians will be fighting their war now...  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[943150050] Where there's Coral, there's blood.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[943150060] That's how it's always been, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[943150070] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[943150080] Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[943150090] Are we...doomed to spark conflict
wherever we go?  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[943160010] About the request to attack the Redguns...
Sounds like V.IV Rusty took care of it.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[943160020] ...Michigan's dead.
Heard he went down fighting.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[943160030] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[943160040] Balam's withdrawn from Rubicon.
The politicians will be fighting their war now...  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[943160050] Where there's Coral, there's blood.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[943160060] That's how it's always been, 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[943160070] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[943160080] Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[943160090] Are we...doomed to spark conflict
wherever we go?  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[943170010] Augmented human C4-621—Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[943170020] The project is nearing fruition.  </p>
<h4>Section 20</h4>
<p>[943170030] We will meet again—
when you reach the Coral convergence.  </p>
<h3>9450</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[945000010] Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[945000020] I see them so clearly...  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[945000030] The voices of the Coral... My family.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[945000040] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[945000050] Brothers and sisters,
consumed by the Fires of Ibis.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[945000060] Only a few survived, but after all this time,
they've finally formed a new flock...  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[945000070] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[945000080] It looks like Walter has sent you a message.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[945000090] Let's take a look, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[945001010] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[945001020] Let me tell you a story before you go.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[945001030] There once was a scientist. He abandoned his family
to delve into the secrets of Coral.  </p>
<h4>Section 12</h4>
<p>[945001040] His work yielded a carnival of horrors.
Augmentation surgery included.  </p>
<h4>Section 13</h4>
<p>[945001050] But there was another scientist.  </p>
<h4>Section 14</h4>
<p>[945001060] He took his colleague's sins upon himself
and set it all ablaze... Died with no regrets.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[945001070] ...There's a lesson in this story.  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[945001080] Once something's alive, it doesn't die easy.  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[945001090] 621.  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[945001100] Story time's over. It's time for work.  </p>
<h3>9501</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[950100010] Back in your old AC?
You were made for each other.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[950100020] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[950100030] The fact that you're still alive
means that Walter made the right bet.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[950100040] Alright. You deserve to know
what we've been fighting for.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[950100050] I'll get you introduced with the next mission.  </p>
<h3>9601</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[960100010] Just went to say goodbye to Chatty.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[960100020] He was an AI I developed.
Could've moved him into a new body, but...  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[960100030] Well, I never could bring myself to back him up.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[960100040] It'd be like taking the life out of him.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[960100050] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[960100060] ...You seem like you've lost someone too.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[960100070] Hope I'm just imagining things.  </p>
<h3>9701</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[970100010] ...Carla had planned everything,
even her own death.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[970100020] Just like Walter...
They both wanted someone to inherit their legacy...  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[970100030] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[970100040] The Rubiconians are continuing to resist
the corporations on the ground, even now.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[970100050] The potential of humanity and Coral
isn't the only thing we have to protect.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[970100060] Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[970100070] There has to be something we can do.  </p>
<h3>9800</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[980000010] We've received a message from ALLMIND.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[980000020] It sounds like they want to bring you under their
protection as part of the Coral Release project.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[980000030] Let's hear them out.  </p>
<h3>9811</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[981100010] Raven, we've received a request from ALLMIND.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[981100020] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[981100030] We've chosen Coral Release...
To pursue humanity and Coral's potential.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[981100040] Now that the choice is made, we have to carry on.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[981100050] No matter what obstacles confront us.  </p>
<h3>9821</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[982100010] Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[982100020] You see it too, don't you?  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[982100030] The Coral voices...waiting to be released
from the Vascular Plant.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[982100040] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[982100050] We've received a message from ALLMIND.  </p>

<p>[990700010] Congratulations. You have completed all ranks.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[990700020] Though these encounters may be simulated,
you have reached the apex of our roster.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[990700030] We would be grateful were you to aid us
in our research and development.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[990700040] ALLMIND exists for all mercenaries.  </p>
<h3>9911</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[991100010] Thank you for your continued support.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[991100020] Your testing has identified several key points
for improvement to MIND ALPHA.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[991100030] The evolution of ALLMIND will not disappoint.  </p>
<h3>9912</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[991200010] Thank you for your continued support.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[991200020] We have obtained some very useful data...  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[991200030] Knowledge that can only be gleaned from
pitting two humanoid weapons against each other.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[991200040] ALLMIND's evolution is just beginning.  </p>
<h3>9913</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[991300010] Thank you for your continued support.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[991300020] Our analysis thus far has revealed
some mission-critical items for research.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[991300030] This concludes the Integration Program's role.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[991300040] The day will come when
ALLMIND's evolution truly takes form.  </p>
<h3>9914</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[991400010] What do you think ALLMIND
is collecting all this data for?  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[991400020] I'm concerned about what these notes mean...  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[991400030] What is the "primary factor?"  </p>
<h3>9915</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[991500010] That machine... It clearly used Coral technology.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[991500020] But what connection does it have
to the Fires of Ibis?  </p>
<h3>9916</h3>
<h4>Section 00</h4>
<p>[991600010] That was incredible, Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[991600020] There's something I realized
when I was playing the role of pilot.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[991600030] Humanity assumed its current form
to fight itself.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[991600040] To choose from infinite selections.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[991600050] That is the essence of the human race...  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[991600060] and the key to biological evolution.  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[991600070] ...  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[991600080] Perhaps it is also a clue to
what ALLMIND's true goal is.  </p>

<h4>Section 00</h4>

<h4>Section 01</h4>
<p>[992000020] You have submitted all combat logs
requested for the Loghunt Program.  </p>
<h4>Section 02</h4>
<p>[992000030] In recognition of your achievement,
you are hereby certified as an Elite Hunter.  </p>
<h4>Section 03</h4>
<p>[992001010] Augmented human C4-621—Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 04</h4>
<p>[992001020] You have submitted all combat logs
requested for the Loghunt Program.  </p>
<h4>Section 05</h4>
<p>[992001030] Are you...the type of person who doesn't
start work until just before the deadline?  </p>
<h4>Section 06</h4>
<p>[992001040] No matter.
The important thing is that the work is done.  </p>
<h4>Section 07</h4>
<p>[992002010] Augmented human C4-621—Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 08</h4>
<p>[992002020] It appears the simulator
struggled to hold your interest.  </p>
<h4>Section 09</h4>
<p>[992002030] But perhaps your self-possession
is what is needed to achieve great things.  </p>
<h4>Section 10</h4>
<p>[992002040] We will learn from your example.  </p>
<h4>Section 11</h4>
<p>[992003010] Your conquest of the arena ranks has been confirmed.
Congratulations.  </p>

<p>[992004010] Augmented human C4-621—Raven.  </p>
<h4>Section 15</h4>
<p>[992004020] Your assistance with the Program is appreciated—
but why now?  </p>
<h4>Section 16</h4>
<p>[992004030] Do you think...  </p>
<h4>Section 17</h4>
<p>[992004040] Do you think that the Release Project
may yet succeed one day?  </p>
<h4>Section 18</h4>
<p>[992004050] We...admire how your thinking is not limited
by the human lifespan.  </p>
<h4>Section 19</h4>
<p>[992005010] The Integration Program has come to a close.
You have our thanks.  </p>

<h2>武器名.fmg</h2>
<h3>MA-J-200 RANSETSU-RF [10000000]</h3>
<p>Burst rifle developed by BAWS. Consumes kinetic
ammunition to deliver on reliable offensive potential,
both in terms of damage and impact. Can be charged
to fire burst shots.</p>
<h3>LR-036 CURTIS [10000100]</h3>
<p>High-speed linear rifle developed by Balam.
A special type of rifle that accelerates rounds using
electromagnetic propulsion. Charging the weapon further
increases round velocity, in turn increasing damage.</p>
<h3>LR-037 HARRIS [10000200]</h3>
<p>High-firepower linear rifle developed by Balam.
The lengthened barrel provides extra distance for rounds
to accelerate, allowing for high damage at long range.
However, this comes at the cost of rapid-fire potential.</p>
<h3>MA-J-201 RANSETSU-AR [10010000]</h3>
<p>Burst assault rifle developed by BAWS. This weapon offers
high accuracy and spontaneous firepower thanks to its
burst-oriented design, leading to its mass production
for use by new recruits to the Rubicon Liberation Front.</p>
<h3>RF-024 TURNER [10010100]</h3>
<p>Standard assault rifle developed by Balam. Balances
rapid-fire performance and firepower, making it easy to
use on full auto. A long-selling classic popular with
anyone from new corporate recruits to veteran mercenaries.</p>
<h3>RF-025 SCUDDER [10010200]</h3>
<p>High-firepower assault rifle developed by Balam.
This variation has been adjusted to focus on the offensive
performance of individual shots. However, the longer
firing cycle demands more precise aiming.</p>
<h3>MA-E-210 ETSUJIN [10020000]</h3>
<p>Burst machine gun developed by BAWS.
The burst-oriented design of this weapon makes it both
easy to use and highly accurate. A strong candidate for
use as a sub-weapon in lightweight builds.</p>
<h3>MG-014 LUDLOW [10020100]</h3>
<p>Machine gun developed by Balam. Has excellent rapid-fire
output, but somewhat lacking in firepower when used
alone. Shines in Double Trigger builds, whether using two
of this weapon or in combination with another.</p>
<h3>DF-MG-02 CHANG-CHEN [10020200]</h3>
<p>Machine gun developed by Dafeng Core Industries.
This weapon was designed for sustained combat potential,
and uses oversize ammunition magazines. Minimal need
for reloading makes it well suited for suppressive fire.</p>
<h3>DF-GA-08 HU-BEN [10030000]</h3>
<p>Gatling gun developed by Dafeng Core Industries. Equipped
with overwhelming rapid-fire performance and sustained
firepower, it embodies the "domination through material
superiority" mantra of Dafeng's parent company, Balam.</p>
<h3>LITTLE GEM [10040000]</h3>
<p>Compact bazooka developed by Melinite. Designed for
lightweight builds and indoor engagements. Compromises
have been made on the number and precision of rounds, but
it amply retains Melinite's trademark explosive power.</p>
<h3>MAJESTIC [10040100]</h3>
<p>Medium-sized bazooka developed by Melinite. Known for
their attention to detail, even down to the composition of
the explosive charges, Melinite's engineers designed this
weapon for efficiency and ease of use from the ground up.</p>
